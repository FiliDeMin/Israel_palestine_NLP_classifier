How big of a deal is this inside the community?,u/VariousImprovement83,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/15ez9ek/im_a_nonjewish_26f_and_im_dating_a_jewish_man_28m/,"I (26F) am dating a jewish (28M) man. Im not religious at all and although things are great, I wonder how big of a deal it really is for someone in the Jewish diaspora to date someone that is not Jewish and also doesn't follow any religion.

I have feelings for him, but Im an immigrant who doesn't know how my visa status will be in the country we are in some months, so we knew since the beginning that some limitations were involved. Im also not looking for anything serious cause I just broke up a seven years long relationship.

Still, he is the first person I really like in a very long time. Im afraid he diesnt see me as someone he could possibly like, and is only using me for physical attraction, especially because Im not Jewish nor follow any religion and Im from Brazil. I have the feeling that women from Brazil are somehow perceived in a less ""serious"" way by men here (we both live in Canada).

Should I just assume he would never take me seriously? Should I move on to someone more ""compatible""? How Jewish men in general perceive women outside of the community? 

I like him, and Im not particularly looking for anything serious, but Im also not comfortable with the idea of dating multiple people at once, so I wanted to clarify some concepts before deciding to either move on to my next option or keep seeing him.

For info: he is not ortodox, quite liberal actually, but I feel that rhe fact that Im not Jewish might be a problem in the future (if ""future"" is even in the picture). He is the first person I have feelings for in a while, and I wanted to see realistically what are the odds here.

Thank you!"

A little about me, my mother is catholic, and my father is fully Ashkenazi Jewish. I was raised in a dual household, we observed the traditions of both such as Hanukkah and Christmas, I attended Bar Mitzvah’s And Bat Mitzvah’s (though never had one of my own), but I wasn’t raised as strictly Jewish or Catholic. In Elementary school for the holidays I would be given both Hanukkah and Christmas coloring pages, and whenever a kid would ask why I was coloring a 
Menorah, I would puff out my chest and proudly declare “I’m half Jewish!” I would also draw Dreidels in after school daycare and proudly bring them to my Dad after school. My Dad taught us about the traditions and what they mean, and we grew up with Jewish foods. My Grandmother raised us with Yiddish phrases, my favorites being “Tuchus” and “Mishegas” (I was a child, can you blame me? Haha) 

My parents divorced when I was 13 due to a lot of really horrible events that I don’t want to delve into, but it did mean that I ended up with my Mom in another state and visited my Dad back in my home state every so often. Because no one on my mothers side is Jewish, we stopped observing Jewish traditions and Holiday’s as much. 

Fast forward, I as an adult am learning more about my Jewish heritage, connecting with my Dad and his friends and family (family on that side is mighty complicated) I’m also in the LGBTQ+ community, and was somewhat recently diagnosed as Autistic. These factors made Judaism, Reform in particular, something that I felt very gravitated to - that I belonged with, felt safe and accepted with — plus the fact that I am half Ashkenazi. 

I found a Temple and had a Zoom call with the Rabbi a while back (who was really wonderful!) and explained everything that I stated in this post — she told me that if I wanted to take Intro to Judaism and convert than by all means go for it, but said that due to my upbringing, in Reform, I’m “just as Jewish as she is and can call myself Jewish and identify as Jewish now if I want.”

This conflicts with what I’ve read, where in Reform law you’re only considered Jewish through Patrilineal descent if you were raised exclusively as Jewish, as well as attend a Jewish school which I have not, I only attended mainstream schools.

I do have an anxiety disorder as well as OCD, so perhaps this is all me overthinking, and apologies if that’s the case! But I would fear that me calling myself Jewish would be almost deceitful / untrue or perhaps even harmful or offensive without converting; although the Rabbi said that I can. 

This is why I’d love to hear your opinions and thoughts. Would I be allowed to call myself Jewish through Reform? Or should I not until I am am able to attend Temple, complete the Intro To Judaism classes and officially fully convert? (The temple is an hour away each way and I have disabilities that affect driving which is a part of why I ask! We don’t have temples close by where I live unfortunately)

Thank you all so much, I appreciate your time!! ♥️

1,2023-08-01,This is a fun one,u/Friendly_Ice_9622,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/15f43ib/this_is_a_fun_one/,"So essentially, I’ve been feeling a little weird about my identity since realizing how I was raised wasn’t the norm (I discovered this maybe 6 months ago). 
To surmise: I was raised with the Jewish culture and religion until I was about 14. 
We observed Shabbat, we celebrated Hanukkah, all of my friends had bat mitzvahs, I was the only one who liked raddish at Seder… etc etc… I thought Rosh Hashanah was like a family thing… and then I discovered it wasn’t lol. 
I realized it wasn’t really all that ‘normal’ for someone raised in the Bible Belt to know the meanings of shin,nun, gimmel, and hey. But all the while my family considers themselves very strictly atheist. We didn’t have a synagogue in my town either so I just chalked it up to being the nature of the UU church we went to. 
I’ve talked to my dad about this, and he says we observed these things because of a distant relative or something. 
He’s also vaguely said my great grandmother Emma was really nervous about the world war because of possible Jewish lineage, but she was from Switzerland and the Nazi party never occupied that country as far as I’m aware.
 I’ve talked to a lot of my Jewish friends about my upbringing and they say it’s practically identical to theirs, including the vagueness of labels and identity. 
But yet even after reading “Am I A Jew?” By Theodore Ross, I have a lot of confusion about my identity (despite feeling incredibly seen by his experience as well).

I would feel incredibly weird claiming a heritage and culture that is only vaguely outlined in my past. 

I just feel like I might be doing that white girl thing where we try to have less proximity to our privilege by claiming a vague identity or something maybe subconsciously.

Another thing is ever since these discoveries everyone has been incredibly weird about my nose (again). 

I’m also sorry if anything I wrote comes off as arrogant."

I am interested to know what Jewish Israelis think of their Arabic speaking Christian neighbors.

Does it make a difference to you whether they hold Palestinian or Israeli citizenship?

Does it make a difference where they are living? 

If they had Israeli citizenship, are they treated objectively and/or subjectively equal in society to Jewish Israelis?

I have heard that Assyrians are treated better than Arabic speaking Christians, is this true?

To be clear- I’m not talking about Christians in general. I’m talking about Arabic speaking Christians with long established roots in Israel. 

Are Israeli citizens who are Arabic speaking Christians forced to serve in the Israeli military?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zhixy8jc9gfb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2385cd2e612db176e29dcbacfa5732ded8845dba

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

We process our stream of consciousness, experiences, memories, and emotions using a verbal framework. This is not a one-way relationship; the verbal does not serve the non-verbal, but rather they develop together.

The verbal framework we use does not seem to be determined solely by pure non-verbal experience. There are probably many different frameworks that might be effective at fulfilling our experiential needs. We express assertions in words drawn from one such framework or another, and sometimes we experience certainty regarding these assertions. We then use short chains of inference to produce more assertions that share this certainty.

One verbal framework that we often use to express our truths about ourselves, and the larger groups of people we coordinate with, is the collective perspective. When viewing the world through a purely collective lens, the people who make up our society are often seen as components, even just cogs, operating as part of a larger machine.

A different perspective sees the world as composed only of individuals. Each of these individuals has a space around them that is their own, where they have the right to decide, desire, and express a vision for its future. The language of this framework makes heavy use of words such as ""theirs"" and ""rights.""

Working with these two perspectives in an integrated fashion is not easy; the contradictions between the two frameworks tend to keep our thinking rooted in one or the other at any given time, or in any given discourse.

When considering the projects that society as a whole should strive to succeed at, it is natural to think within the collective framework. As the future looms large and even causes some panic, it becomes more difficult to see the individuals and the spaces around them. Moreover, an individual is a finite entity with a clear end-time, and therefore does not seem to be a productive concept for thinking about the future. However, we forget that an individual may be bounded in time, but their space includes their preferred vision for the future. Visions are less time-limited.

One might challenge the assumption that our thinking is overly collectivized. Is not the opposite true? Are most of our problems not caused by the selfish nature of human beings? It is because people see only themselves and their own needs that we are in such a mess.

Perhaps there is a deeper way of looking at what ""selfish"" means. Consider the idealist who takes nothing for themselves, someone who gives endlessly. Perhaps, surprisingly, there are examples of such people who are, in fact, ultra-selfish. They do not believe in the ego or further their self-interest. They have dissolved their own ego in favor of the group. However, perhaps they have merged their ego with the group, and the group becomes their super-ego. They have expanded their ego to encompass the whole world.

Louis XIV, the King of France, famously declared, ""L'état c'est moi,"" meaning ""The state is me."" Do not some visionaries say the same thing? Such idealists might give everything they have to everybody, but they demand that their vision of the truth and the future apply to everybody. In doing so, they trample the spaces that are not theirs to enter.

Perhaps we should take special care not to ignore the spaces around others. The atoms, or building blocks, out of which we shape our common future should be the individual together with their spaces."

I'm not asking for an agarah of anyone's money, just who can I speak to in order to get government subsidies? 

Non of the ones relating to Olim Hadashim will help me, even if agents of theirs say I'm eligible their bosses call me back, sometimes speaking, other times yelling, no.

Is there any help for normal Ezrahim? 

Most of these problems stems from Corona, I was unemployed for 2 years after my military service as a Hayel Boded and was frequently told wrong info on how to get unemployment, some from ill informed friends, others from Bituah Leumi, I'm in a pickle and I'm really concerned for my future.

For my mental health I can't afford to work 2 jobs, I've only now started to get therapy (I've been working on getting it for 3 years).

But yeah if any of you fine folk know who or what to contact for getting formal economic assistance I'd greatly appreciate that. 

If not we'll thanks for your time."
1,2023-08-01,Things I've recently learned about South Africa,u/SpontaneousFlame,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/15f947f/things_ive_recently_learned_about_south_africa/,"I've been doing a bit of reading recently on South Africa under apartheid and there are some interesting parallels with today:

* South Africans believed God was on their side and supported their supremacy.
* South Africa believed in suppression of the majority population and favoured restricting where the majority non-Afrikaner population could live, what rights they had and their political participation.
* South Africa used the non-Afrikaner population as a source of cheap labour.
* South Africa rejected all criticism of their policies any sort.  
* South Africa set aside 80% of its land for white use only.
* South Africa lied, hid and denied the past: death squads, torture, ehtnic cleansing and massacres were all officially denied even though they were common knowledge when they occurred and supported by the white minority.
* South Africa did not teach its history in its schools.  People who left South Africa frequently were astonished at how different their taught history was to their real history.
* South Africa had a deliberate policy of educational inequality - funding for white students was vastly greater than funding for black students.
* South Africa had a policy of denying territorial contiguity and allowing only limited self-rule for the majority population.
* South Africa had a policy of forcibly dispossessing black farmers and selling their land at very low cost to white farmers.  
* South Africa used a permit system to control the movement and economy of the majority population.  Anyone not white caught without a permit was subject to arrest or arbitrary detention.
* Apartheid police officials were granted extensive powers when policing non-whites.  They were able to detain without charge anyone non-white for an arbitrary length of time.  Soldiers were also used to control the majority non-white population, and they had even greater freedom of action than police officers.
* South Africa conscripted white men into the army to fight wars of aggression and to prevent Namibian independence.  
* South African police officers and soldiers often used violence against peaceful protesters.  White police officers and soldiers who opened fire on unarmed black people faced no charges and were supported and sometimes feted by the white minority.  White civilians were able to freely use violence against the majority and again, faced no charges for the use of such violence.  The reverse, where the black majority resorting to violence against white south africans, was denounced by the government and white civilians.

Just food for thought..."

1,2023-08-01,"""The transition from a Jewish state to true democracy will benefit all"" - My take on Ner Kitri's excellent piece on Mondoweiss",u/AlainAlam,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/15fdgcn/the_transition_from_a_jewish_state_to_true/,"In case you haven't seen it, Ner Kitri, an ODS supporter and apparently a Jewish Israeli, published a piece titled [""The transition from a Jewish state to true democracy will benefit all""](https://mondoweiss.net/2023/07/the-transition-from-a-jewish-state-to-true-democracy-will-benefit-all/) on Mondoweiss. I think this is the first article of its kind, as it actually makes the case that relinquishing colonial privileges and transitioning from settler to citizen is ""an upgrade, not a downgrade"" to quote his words.

First of all this is politically sound, as the issue was never Jews' *presence* in Palestine (there has always been Jews in Palestine, and nobody ever said a Palestinian state would be the first zero-immigration policy state in the world), but their settler-colonial political project to establish a Jewish state in Palestine (المشكلة مش اقامة يهود انما اقامة دولة لليهود بأرضنا).

But more than that, the arguments made are very sound, and a few of them were actually new to me. I'll give just a few examples:

* It delegitimizes the idea that ""in a democratic Palestinian state, Palestinians would kill Jews"" by saying that Palestinians are thirsty for liberation, not for blood, and by giving two examples: The emancipation of slaves in the USA and the end of apartheid in South Africa, neither of which led to a genocide of the former oppressors
* He also makes the amazing argument that a democratic state would still protect its citizens from any internal or external threats! In other words you don't need a settler colonial state to protect you, just a state, so why insist on settler colonialism? Unless the true objective is colonization, not survival! This lays the Zionist arguments bare
* He also speaks of how a democratic state would actually offer sincere Jews *more* rights, since many Jews who feel a religious connection to Hebron could have free access to it under a Palestinian state, something the Israeli state can't offer, so again: why insist on settler colonialism? What are their true intentions
* And he also speaks of how the Zionist colonial enterprise views and treats Jewish citizens of European countries as Jews rather than Europeans, which estranges them from their societies, which is actually what's really dangerous to them, contrary to Zionism's proclaimed objective (to protect Jews)

All in all I think this is a great article because 1) it gives us sound anti-hasbara arguments to use with sincere people, 2) it gives a clear delimitation of what supporting the Palestinian cause means, so next time we want to know if someone's a liberal Zionist or a true ally of our cause we just show them the article and ask them if they agree (it's sus if they don't!), 3) for the first time we're the ones offering a political vision that Israelis will be divided around rather than them dividing us. Of course, this third point needs to be worked on and improved in an organized way, which the Initiative is certainly going to do.

Would love to hear your thoughts!"

So I just had a nightmare of a day trying to open a bank account here.

For some context:

I am from South Africa and I just finished a MASA program and am now working full time on a B/1 work visa. 
I work in Hi-Tech as software engineer and am due my first salary.

I have heard good (by Israeli standards) things about discount so I thought I would go there. I gave them the necessary information and documents. Visa, employment contract and payslip.

Long story short I was there from 8:30am until 1:30pm trying to open an account. The branch manager said they were unable to open an account for me without a south African tax number, however because I never worked in South Africa I never had to register as a tax resident and therefore do not have a tax number in South Africa nor am I a tax resident there. I have however registered as a tax resident in Israel and even have a tax number here in Israel. 

Depsite trying to explain this to the bank manager a number of times she seemed absolutely uninterested and just kept telling me how they can't open me any bank account without my south African tax number. And so I must just register as a tax resident in South Africa quickly and then give her my TIN number (obviously I was not even remotely willing to do that)

I get the feeling she was just a useless manager so I plan to try a different branch tomorrow as I find it impossible to believe that I cannot open a bank account with a signed contract in high tech, payslip, work visa and Israeli tax number.

For reference South Africa is not like the US in regards to tax. It's as simple as, I never registered as a tax resident there since I never worked in the country and so, I am by law, not a tax resident of South Africa 

So if anyone has any experience trying to deal with this I would highly appreciate it.

I would also appreciate any advice on which banks are best.

Thanks so mucb everyone"

However, wherever, and with whomever you’re going to make a shidduch, you won’t be *alone* for this most enamorative day of the year. Ask questions and share ideas here to help your fellow Jews find their b'sheret in the most appropriate ways.

The Fifteenth of Av starts this year at sunset on **Tuesday, August 01** and runs until dark on **Wednesday, August 02**. On haLuakh haIvri, it all happens on . . . **15 Av**.

[Chag HaAhava](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wj-0WMq5A9U/Vc-AzTK4h4I/AAAAAAAACKA/uld6-0HhB4k/s1600/The-Lion-King-romance-scene.gif) initially marked the start of the grape harvest (alcohol and matchmaking, a shidduch unto itself) as well as the completion of preparing the wood sacrifice at the Temple.

 The Feast of Xylophory (""Wood-bearing"") also marks when:

* inter-tribal (intra-Israelite) relations were permitted following our conquest of Canaan under Joshua, and again years later specifically for the Tribe of Benjamin after a nasty event told in Sefer Shoftim;
* the remaining members of the generation of the Spies realized they were going to enter Eretz Yisrael with the new generation;
* the northern tribes were allowed to access the Temple under King Hoshea;
* the victims of the Bethar massacre (follow-up to the Bar Kokhba Revolt, on Tisha b'Av) by the Romans were allowed to be buried; and
* the nights are longer, which means more time to study!

* [Chabad](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/53680/jewish/15th-of-Av.htm)

* [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/topics/xylophory?tab=sources)
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_B'Av)

These links were from a quick consultation with Rav Google (and just knowing some good resources). Tu b'Av is not very popular in the Diaspora and in Heterodox communities, but you should still contact your local Jewish person/synagogue/community center for more information on local practice or events.

When I was going through it, I met a woman who was doing the process with her husband and kid and she mentioned that she was able to do so through the Jewish Federation of Winnipeg, so I thought it would be an idea to share here, maybe there's someone looking to immigrate and this could be a great opportunity.

Here's how it goes - Canada has a points-system program called Express Entry which you can immigrate directly as a Permanent Resident. And each province also has its own immigration programs and they can give out Province Nominations, meaning that they want you specifically living there (usually through a job or language demand). So you create a profile for the federal process (Express Entry) and a Province can invite you to live there, and that will give you I think 500 points which would basically guarantee that you are invited for the Federal program and apply for the residency.

It happens that the Jewish Federation of Winnipeg welcomes Jews from other countries into their community to help it grow so they also send out these invitations if you go through their process. Meaning, you would obviously have to create a Federal profile and fit all their criteria but you would receive an invitation from the Province of Manitoba through the Jewish Federation.

It can all seem a little confusing, but if you are someone who's looking to live elsewhere, maybe Canada could be a good place for you. I will leave here a link explaining the Express Entry program as well as a link to the Jewish Federation of Winnipeg:

[https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada.html)

[https://www.jewishwinnipeg.org/immigration-to-winnipeg](https://www.jewishwinnipeg.org/immigration-to-winnipeg)

I lost contact with the woman I was talking, but I know it worked out for her because last we chatted she was a few days away from moving to Canada, I remember her saying she felt very welcome by the community during their exploratory visit and couldn't wait to permanently move there. I went through the process but not through the Federation because I only found out about it after I already had my process ongoing, so I'm living elsewhere in Canada."

(Europe),u/dudbbdudhddb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/15fjdie/is_it_disrespectful_for_a_nonobservant_jew_to/,"I just moved to a European city recently, and there is an organized jewish community here, which I am in the process of becoming a member of. I am a completely non-observant jew, but I do not think this itself is an issue, as the organization describes itself as representing the entire jewish community, from ""very orthodox and traditional to liberal and secular"".

I believe that membership grants access to the cities main synagogue, which I believe operates under orthodox rules -- I know that men sit on the ground floor and women sit on the balcony.

Now, even though I am non-observant, the idea of attending synagogue once a week is something that I really like, and I think it would be good for me set aside some time for G-d; as well as also being around other jews and jewish culture. But then I started  realizing - the synagogue, while very close by subway, is about an hour and a half walk away from my house. And while for me, taking the subway in itself is not a big deal, because I don't plan on observing shabbat, I am worried that maybe taking the train to synagogue itself could actually be disrespectful. So I am wondering what I should do."

I’m doing some reference checks on employee candidates at work. One of the references is a rabbi, and I’m not sure how to address her in the email. 

When I address the rabbis at my shul, one prefers Rabbi [surname] and the other Rabbi [first name]. But for work emails, I typically default to the person’s first name and my salutation is usually “Hi [firstname],”

I was going to use “Hi Rabbi [surname],” but it doesn’t sound right. I think her hyphenated last name is making it seem more formal. “Dear Rabbi [surname]” feels too formal compared with the rest of the email. Yet, Rabbi [first name] somehow seems less appropriate than just using her first name. 

This has more to do with social anxiety than Judaism, but wondering how you folks would proceed"

I only have a small Jewish part of ancestors. And I made friends with someone who has a typically Jewish sounding last name, even a Jewish mother, but wasn't raised Jewish and doesn't define themselves as it. Their last name had a twist in it's spelling, showing clearly from which country the name was, which makes it kind of rare. It's one of the few countries that I don't find in my family tree.
Anyway, I just found out that this last name is in my (very extended) ancestry. And according to the internet, there's only a very low number of that name counted globally, even in other spellings (which may get translated when people move countries or switch from Hebrew to Latin letters).. So I guess we're cousins! (I say that jokingly, I know I still have to confirm common ancestry and also being the cousin's cousin's cousin or something doesn't mean much but I found it funny, finding a potential family connection to a person who I like anyway :-) )

And what's your story on unexpectedly finding a relative?:D

TL;DR: I'm not even fully Jewish, neither is my friend, yet we're totally in on that joke! (Also don't take this too seriously, of course I do not think that everyone is related)"

One of my favorite parables as a kid was the one about the Rabbi and the Storm (no, not Noah's Ark). It's a classic Jewish story/joke, yet it pokes fun at blind faith. Here's how it goes:

In a coastal city where a very observant rabbi lived, a hurricane was coming, a bad one. In the days leading up to the storm, the governor advised that everyone, especially those living on the barrier islands, evacuate and get as far away from the coast as possible. The rabbi's wife agreed and told him that they and the children need to evacuate. The rabbi said, ""I'm not going anywhere, God will save me"".  The wife and kids, however, saw that it was useless to argue further, the rabbi was just too stubborn, so they evacuated and decided to stay with family further inland.

Once it was clear that the city would be in the direct path of the hurricane, the governor issued a mandatory evacuation, so a neighbor stopped by and said, ""Rabbi, we have to get out of here before the storm comes. Let's go."" Once again, the rabbi said, ""I appreciate the concern, but I follow all of God's commandments; he will save me."" The neighbor saw that it was useless to argue further, the rabbi was just too stubborn, so he left with his family.

The storm was beginning to make its way over the beaches, and it had been upgraded to a Category 4. This time the police came and said, ""Rabbi, we're saving the people who got left behind, you've gotta come with us now. This storm is no joke."" Again, the rabbi made the same comment about his undying faith and that God would save him. The cop saw that it was useless to argue further, the rabbi was just too stubborn, so he left to rescue other people left behind.

The storm hit hard and caused serious flooding, forcing the rabbi to flee to the upper floor of his house. This time, the Coast Guard came by with a boat and once again, tried to convince the rabbi to escape the storm but again, he responded that God would save him. Seeing that it was useless to argue further, the rabbi was just too stubborn, so the Coast Guardsmen sailed off.

The flooding worsened, so the Rabbi had to flee to the roof of his house. It was finally safe enough to send in an Army helicopter. The pilot said to the rabbi, ""Sir, grab on, we'll get you out of here!"" Again, the rabbi responded with his usual spiel about how God would save him. Seeing that it was useless to argue further the rabbi was just too stubborn, so the soldiers flew off. As the helicopter flew out of sight, a huge tidal wave swept over the city, and the rabbi was swept away by the flood's current and drowned.

In heaven, the rabbi asked God, ""Why didn't you save me? I was a good man, I did everything you asked. Why did you let me die?"" After appraising the rabbi as if he were a science experiment gone wrong, God responded, ""I sent you two government warnings, a neighbor, a cop, the Coast Guard, and the freaking United States Army to help you flee, but you decided to stay put like an idiot. What did you expect, that you'd sprout wings and fly off to safety like a bird?""

TL;DR: You can have your faith, that's all cool (as long as you don't shame others for thinking differently), but when it comes time to make a critical decision, don't be a moron. To paraphrase House, you can talk all you want about God, angels, and faith, but when it comes time for you to cross the street, I know you'll look both ways before doing so. If you have blind faith, you may just find yourself blindly walking into oncoming traffic."

They're coming at fomenting division from a few different angles, one of which is religion: according to the intro, the cast includes a Christian pastor, a Texas rabbi, and an observant Muslim. I was genuinely excited to see the rabbi, so you can imagine my dismay when the little montage showed him performing an obvious baptism. So I googled his name, and guess what his 'shul' is called?

I grew up in an Israeli right wing religious home. We were right wing to such an extent, that I even remember cheering when Rabin was assassinated. Even though I was just a kid at the time, it’s still embarrassing to admit it. At the time we perceived Rabin to be a traitor who “gave the Arabs guns”. (Ps. Given the rising terrorist attacks and suicide bombings in the aftermath of the Oslo, even at this time that thought doesn’t seem so far fetched). At the time I also joined protests that were happening in opposition to Oslo accords. I essentially saw Israel as “ours”, both historically, but also religiously. In other words, I believed that God gave us this land. This had far reaching implications religiously, as we saw ‘the Arabs’ as descendants of Biblical Ishmael, and as tradition has it, Ishmael was out to destroy Jacob. Later in the USA, I had a debate with my history teacher, and I was preaching to him about the virtues of Israel and how the IDF was maintaining ‘purity of arms’. When he asked me: “what about Dir Yassin?” I innocently replied, “what’s Dir Yassin?”. When he explained to me that it was a massacre perpetrated by the Jewish troops I was in disbelief. Later I asked an older family member about it, and he said that it was true, but that it was necessary at the time. I couldn’t accept such an idea.

Fast forward some years later, through the Internet, I learned that I wasn’t told half the story about the conflict. See, from our perspective, we were the victims who through incredible resilience and near miracle, happened to defeat the Arabs. We were never taught about the ethnic cleansing during ‘48 and ‘67. We were not taught matters such as that the plaza in front of the Western Wall was actually an Arab neighborhood, which was demolished to create the Western Wall praying plaza, and that it’s old inhabitants were displaced and pushed to Shuafat refugee camp. We weren’t taught that the ruins we see as we traverse Road 1 on the way to Jerusalem, are ruins of Palestinian villages, destroyed in ‘48. We were not told that the KKL’s obsession of planting trees, is for the purpose of literally covering up the presence of old dis-inhabited/destroyed Arab villages.

In short, and this took me years to figure out, I’ve figured out that the israel that I knew didn’t actually ever exist. Sure we weren’t necessarily the evil ones in the grand scheme of things, as it was a bloody war and was preceded by Arab massacring Jews. However, the biggest issue for me is the erasure of the history of this conflict by Israel, which continues to this day. It’s one thing to defend actions that you believe were justified given the circumstances. It’s another matter altogether to cover up actual historical incidents.

There is more of course, such as continues mistreatment of Palestinians in West Bank and Gaza. (Locking down of Gaza for the past 17 years or so and preventing free movement of 2 million people). There’s Increased toxicity in Israeli discourse, which to me stems from being an uninhibited, unchecked geopolitical and military power. There is the religious right, which is increasingly dominant in Israeli decision making, and who believe that God gave them the land. The thought that such provincial religious belief drives policy is mind boggling.

In summary, this is not the israel I want to be a part of. So, essentially I’m pre-post Zionist. Not fully post Zionist because I still support the right of Jews to live in Israel, and of course our history is intrinsic to this land. I also have serious reservations about the ability of Palestinians to self govern. And of course I do in no way absolve Palestinians of crimes they perpetrated against Jews (terrorism, massacres, destruction of Jewish historical sites, denying Jewish history etc.

Formerly a Zionist, now Post-zionist due to Israeli coverup of history."

Instead the custom began of praying at the Western Wall and crying butthurt tears, hence ""the Wailing Wall"".

There is writing by the famous Israel Zangwill in 1929 describing the events of Jerusalem and the riots at that time. The Mufti Arabs were attempting to oust the pious Jews from their Wailing Wall, a quaint custom seen by the secular people of Tel Aviv etc. However, nobody was going to put up with that kind of affront so the Betar youth marched up to the wall with 6,000 people and demonstrated. This sparked off the 1929 riots which led to massacres throughout Palestine of defenseless black-hatted civilians and their families, unforgivably criminal atrocities that were determined by Allah in 1948. 

This leads to the question of the Western Wall Plaza, and the insistently rising wooden stairs that go up to the former Temple mount. Why is it so extremely important to maintain special access instead of just going through the regular gates like tourists? It seems that lots of propaganda has gone under the bridge here, the Jewish people never cared about this wall until it was a political issue. It seems like the temple area is gaining the same traction, despite having no importance to anybody not even Muslims. It is not the third holiest site in Islam, there are only two holy places which are Mecca and Medina. The phrase Al Aqsa mosque refers to a place in Saudi Arabia.

 I could show links to photos of the Haram Sharif in the 1930s with weeds growing between the cobblestones, the famous golden dome was only established maybe in the 1950s. I don't think anybody went up there to celebrate Ramadan before the 20th century either, when did that even become a thing ? These places of historic significance have been politicized into something radically out of shape to their origins. It seems that a lot of intense feeling about the Old City and environ is completely contrived. The Mufti won 100 years later after all, he made Jerusalem into a burdensome stone for everyone."

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

Conflict poses a significant threat to human well-being, making it crucial to understand its fundamental causes in order to build a better future. Although conflict can arise from various reasons, this post will focus on exploring one specific cause: our perception of how processes will unfold.

Goods can be categorized into those that are mine and those that are yours. For the purpose of this discussion, goods encompass physical objects we need or desire, human rights, relationships, and social position, among other things.

In simple scenarios, I know which goods belong to me and which ones belong to you. Likewise, I assume that you share the same understanding and agreement regarding this distinction.

Only in situations of extreme power disparity would I disregard this distinction between what belongs to you and what belongs to me. Assuming we both recognize the negative consequences of violating this distinction and consider ourselves ethical people, our interactions should remain stable, reducing the likelihood of conflict.

The challenge arises when ownership becomes unclear. Once a disagreement emerges regarding who is entitled to a particular good, both parties may become willing to engage in conflict to assert their claims. It is uncontroversial to state that uncertainty surrounding the rights to goods, particularly when reasonable arguments can be made for both sides, is one of the central underlying causes of any conflict.

However, ambiguity concerning ownership does not inevitably lead to conflict. In fact, if both sides acknowledge this ambiguity, they may be more inclined to compromise or share. The real danger lies in situations where both parties firmly believe in the validity of their conflicting claims. In such cases, one side is less likely to compromise on goods that they are certain exclusively belong to them.

Why should ownership ambiguity arise?

While it is evident that ownership ambiguity can stem from disagreements about the past, historical events, or their interpretations, another contributing factor is uncertainty about the future.

Our world consists of static situations, instantaneous events, and processes that unfold over a finite period. Sometimes, our sense of ownership hinges on our predictions of how a process will ultimately unfold.

If we believe that a process will inevitably lead to us being recognized as the rightful owners of a particular good, we may tend to view it as already belonging to us. Inevitable processes are equivalent to completed ones. If something is destined to become ours, then, in our mind, it is already considered ours.

This is where a problem arises. The future is often less certain than our beliefs would lead us to think. Each party involved in a conflict perceives the process differently and arrives at distinct conclusions about its ultimate outcome. However, both sides might consider their predictions as infallible, fueling their readiness to engage in conflict.

The solution lies in acknowledging our bias towards certainty. By recognizing the possibility of being mistaken about how events will unfold, we may become more open to sharing and compromising."

“Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place. Know therefore and understand that from the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to the coming of an anointed one, a prince, there shall be seven weeks. Then for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time. And after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing. And the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed. And he shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed end is poured out on the desolator.”
Daniel 9:24‭-‬27 ESV
https://bible.com/bible/59/dan.9.24-27.ESV

1. Which decree is it referring to? There are quite a few candidates. 

'...Other candidates include the edict of Cyrus in 539/8 BCE, the decree of Artaxerxes I in 458/7 BCE, and the warrant given to Nehemiah in 445/4 BCE.'

I've read this article, thought I think it is limited. It says how the prince who destroys Jerusalem could Vespasian or Titus, but they came after the 490 years were up."

The religious right have stolen enough of our country that lets be honest was built by secular socialist and only want to steal more. We should: 

- ban Dati and haredi schools and have a single education system 
- end army exemptions, if people dont want to serve they can do sherut Leumi 
- stop child benefits after the 3rd or 4th child 
- not a shekel of public money to the Rabbinut or any Beit knesset, mikvah or yeshiva 
- public transport across the country on shabbat and chagim, including Jerusalem and make it a criminal offence to interfere or block public transport 
- strip the Beit Dein of all formal judicial powers
- ban ordained Rabbis or other religious leaders from being elected to the Knesset or local council 
- make it a criminal offence to enforce any single sex space

For anyone who says this is extreme, this agenda will basically make us like most other European countries. There is no reason we need to continue being held to ransom by the religious minority. 

I would also be in favour of what they do in France and Turkey and ban the wearing of religious symbols like the hijab or kippahs in public spaces, but also people should be free to do what they want. They just shouldnt be able to steal money from the rest of the country to do so."
1,2023-08-02,Germany Journalist and Israel Critic Discoverd to be Not Jewish,u/TracingBullets,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/15g8slv/germany_journalist_and_israel_critic_discoverd_to/,"[Here’s an interesting story](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjtvbduqn) from earlier this month that you may have missed.

> A German intellectual named Fabian Wolff, who has often criticized the Jewish community in Germany and Israel through media outlets associated with the left, was found to have faked his Jewish identity.

> He is known as one of the most vocal critics of the left's opposition to the definition of antisemitism, which can also manifest through criticism or anti-Israel policies, and he supports absolving Muslim antisemitism of blame and that’s in addition to being an enthusiastic supporter of boycott movements against Israel, such as BDS.

> **Wolff's Jewish identity was his ticket to the liberal left.** For years, he published articles in the Jewish newspaper Jüdische Allgemeine Zeitung. Now, after his confession, an article was published under the title “Jew in Disguise,"" mocking Wolff's repeated use of Yiddish motifs in his writings.

> Wolff, who is also a teacher by trade, strongly attacked other Jews, claiming that they were blindly pro-Israel, extreme right-wingers or racists. He used his fabricated Jewish identity to bash fellow Jews. In his confession, he also proved that he is not a Christian either and he never sought forgiveness from anyone he harmed.

The too long, didn’t read version is that a German journalist and teacher lied about being Jewish and was leveraging that identity into becoming one of the most high profile anti-Israel critics in the country before his confession.

So let’s discuss what would make this man risk his credibility and reputation and deploy such a lie.

In my opinion, he did it because, as the article states, “Jewish identity was his ticket to the liberal left.” Despite the anecdotal claims of anonymous Internet users, virulently anti-Israel Jews are quite a rare thing, and each one is worth their weight in gold to the anti-Israel/pro-Palestinian movement.

They are so rare, in fact, that simply being a Jewish anti-Israel activist is enough for a person with that identity to make a living that way. You can look at people like Norman Finkelstein (before he stepped out of line), Peter Beinart, Miko Peled, and others who have made a career out of the ""I'm a Jew who hates Israel"" grift. They are valuable because anti-Semitic pro-Palestinians can point at them and say ""look here's a Jew who agrees with me, therefore I must not be anti-Semitic."" That's all the thought process necessary to make it in the pro-Palestinian movement.

Anti-Israel Muslims and Christians are a dime a dozen but anti-Israel Jews are a valuable commodity, valuable enough for people to lie in order to be them. Fascinating stuff, don’t you think?"

how can the israel palestinian conflict be resolved?

**ChatGPT (GPT-3.5):**

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a complex and longstanding issue with deep historical and emotional roots. There is no easy or one-size-fits-all solution, but several approaches have been proposed to work towards resolving the conflict. Some key elements that could contribute to a resolution include:  
**Negotiations and Diplomacy:** Both parties need to engage in sincere and meaningful negotiations to find a mutually acceptable solution. This process requires compromise, open dialogue, and mediation from the international community.  
**Two-State Solution:** Many experts and international actors support the idea of creating two separate states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. This would involve the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel, with clear borders and shared recognition.  
**Security and Confidence-Building Measures:** Building trust between the parties is crucial. Confidence-building measures can include steps to improve security cooperation, the cessation of violence, and the gradual withdrawal of Israeli settlements from disputed territories.  
**Ending Settlement Expansion:** Israel's continued expansion of settlements in the West Bank is a significant obstacle to peace. Halting further expansion and addressing existing settlements will be essential to reaching an agreement.  
**Jerusalem:** Finding a solution to the status of Jerusalem, which is considered a holy city by both Israelis and Palestinians, is critical. A creative and fair approach to sharing or dividing the city could be part of a comprehensive peace plan.  
**Refugees and Borders:** Addressing the issue of Palestinian refugees and defining secure borders for both states are also key components that need careful consideration.  
**International Support and Monitoring:** A resolution may require the involvement of the international community to provide support, ensure implementation, and monitor compliance with agreements.  
**Public Diplomacy and Education:** Working to change public perceptions and attitudes on both sides is vital. Peace education and efforts to foster mutual understanding can contribute to a more conducive environment for resolving the conflict.  
**Economic Development:** Investing in the economic development of both Israel and Palestine can improve living conditions, reduce poverty, and create incentives for peaceful coexistence.  
**Long-term Commitment:** Resolving such a complex conflict will take time and consistent commitment from all parties involved. It is essential to remain patient, persistent, and resilient in pursuing a sustainable peace.  
It is important to note that the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires the willingness and commitment of both sides, as well as the support and engagement of the international community. While it may seem challenging, history has shown that peace is possible even in the most entrenched conflicts."

The topic is a little strange and caught me off guard so I wanted to check with some of the *actual* users in question. 

Long story short, it is a German brand with an English brand name but it is connected to the German company and heritage. We are trying to enter the American market at the moment. 

We have a new marketing director who wants to change the name for a few reasons but one of the main reasons she is pushing as a high priority is that *she thinks* one of our biggest targets in America would be the Jewish population. We don't know why she says this. She believes that with a name connected to a brand from Germany, not a German-sounding name mind you,  we would be pushing away one of our largest potential user bases. 

To me, and my colleagues, this seems completely irrational and out of nowhere. I have grown up around Jewish people my entire life and never heard of this kind of sentiment. 

I hope this post does not come off as strange but I am genuinely confused and just looking for some honest insight into this topic and if it has any merit or truth behind it. 

Hope this is allowed here and if it is not I apologize!"

my partner and i are extremely passionate about world travel and immersing ourselves in other cultures. i find this to be in direct conflict with keeping kosher, because there are plenty of places where non-kosher food is a big part of the local cuisine. i've been toying around with the idea of ""keep kosher at home"" (our home country) and then while we're travelling we can eat more authentically to the region, whether it's kosher or not at all. 

i think this is a good internal compromise, but i have a really hard time moving past that and putting it into action. i can't imagine ordering anything with pork in it, and i feel like i'd ultimately be unable to due to self-guilt. i know that generally there's plenty of options one can choose from when abroad and looking at a menu, as i do that now when eating out. we recently went to an authentic spanish restaurant that was pretty amazing and there were maybe 2 entrees that were pork-free. it's very limiting at times, but i don't mind in the day-to-day. being on vacation in a new place and having to translate words and sift through menus really takes me out of the immersive experience, i feel. 

does anyone have any suggestions or mantras that might assist with this?

I recently moved to Germany and I live close to Gottingen for the next 4 months. After that, I will move to the Netherlands - 30 minutes drive from Amsterdam (and stay there for at least the coming 5 years). 

For quite some time already, I consider converting to Judaism. Therefore, I am looking for a synagogue in my area here in Germany and then in The Netherlands. Conversion is my goal, but before that, I would like to be able to attend services and learn more about Judaism, so conversion classes would be more than welcome. 

Do you have any ideas on where should I start? First of all, are you aware of any active Jewish community with a Synagogue in/near Gottingen and then one in/near Amsterdam? 

And lastly, are there recognized batei din in The Netherlands?  "

Our little boy was, thank gd, born healthy and had his you-know-what 8 days later. 

I had been very very stressed out about the social/family/event part even though we had a low-key in-home event...when it came to the day I really didn't care about any of the stuff. Just worried about my little dude. 

It was never in question for us, it is an important part of our tradition, but I will say I didn't expect it to feel as...momentous as it did. 

I chose to be at the threshold of the room - I couldn't handle being in a totally different place. Baby boy and I went through labor together so I wasn't leaving him totally alone for this. 

There was...like...a time lapse. Like this weird moment of ""ritual time"" that truly felt connected to thousands of years. It was even more profound for my husband. But it was...important. 

I will say tha it was invaluable for me to be surrounded by other Jewish moms who had been through this - they provided a level of empathy and strength that I really needed, and that was, in itself, very powerful. 

Screenplay idea: we used a mohel recommended by our  friends...and then discovered that three other couples *at our bris* has used the same mohel! So as I sit in the newborn chaos I'm roughing out ideas for the screenplay - I'm thinking a series of vignettes about different stages of Jewish parenthood, with all the parents/kids connected by the same mohel... 🤣"

its not like purple rain where it was mostly- im already a rock star, i just need to think im awesomer.

or bohemian rhapsody where it was like- im a serious rock god, its fucked up i died.

or like the newest star is born- where its like, imma be a rock star. dam, that was fast.

not this movie- there was so much history behind it, it took its time and really told the whole story- the good and the bad.

but you know what the baddest shit in the world was? my very favorite part, was when he sat at the piano and sang 'love on the rocks' and he turned his head and you saw that big ass yamulka?!  i was like 'yeahhhh bad mutherfucker, represent!!!!""  I ALSO LOVE AMERICA!!!!!

oh, and also it was nice to see some of the stuff you do, cuz i never see that either. i thought it was cute the way that old man held his tea, and i liked seeing that place where the kids learn jewish. the movie is so \*fuckin\* wholesome, Prince hits  girls in his movie , Neil Diamond will go the thing to say sorry to his father when he doesnt even want to because he's a beautiful person. Most stories about musicians are not about forgiveness and family and devotion to your faith.  i cant believe its not more popular. we should watch it on 4th of july because we all love new york. i think its so stupid your ways are not more common to see on tv.

1. Palestine wasn’t just dunes before Isræl. The area is actually pretty ecologically diverse with different ecosystems and environments. The “it’s just a desert” kind of seems just an extension of the European orientalist idea that the Middle East is some barren wasteland.

2. It implies that somehow a more luscious (European) environment is better. It is not, not much more to say.

3. It harms the environment. There is a big issue now a days where instead of planting forests in deforested areas, we plant rows of trees in pre-existing environments. And a lot of actions “making the desert bloom” are basically just that, though swap out trees for crops. 

4. You’ve probably seen the videos of Isræli’s burning down olive and orange trees in Palestine. Turning Palestine into a second Europe to make Ashkenazi settlers more comfy is killing the environment and the people relying on the environment, another extension of colonialism.

If someone can embellish or add on to this, that would be greatly appreciated."

It was an unimaginably difficult time. I had family back home in Oregon, so you could say it was a traumatic move :(. But one day, my mom had the idea to take us to a synagogue. I had not seen a synagogue in over 5 years since then, and it was a refreshing visit. I even entered Hebrew school at the age of 16. (much older than anyone else enrolled lmao) 
I didn't like it too much. Studying Hebrew after a while became boring. But it provided me with so much social interaction. Quarantine was absolutely soul crushing, and likely messed with my social development. But still, going to Synagogue kept me mentally sane. I was still dealing with homesickness. 


After a year of Hebrew school, (this year) summer finally arrived!
I learned so many life lessons from that Synagogue. I met so many people. I made so many friends. And yeah, I still struggle with mental issues occasionally. But Synagogue will always be there for me.

I don't go as much as I used to, but I always learn something new every time I go for the Sabbath!

1,2023-08-03,A religious-secular balance proposal,u/Puzzleheaded_Law_336,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/15gsyne/a_religioussecular_balance_proposal/,"So, given a recent post regarding a complete secularization of Israel, I wanted to get thoughts on my idea of a compromise framework that will make Israel more secular-friendly but still maintain (and arguably improve) its Jewish character.

1. Ultra-Orthodox Israelis will have to serve in the Israeli army, except for the 25% who are the high-achievers in their studies, as determined by a standardized test. To incentivize general education among Haredi society, the test will include sections on secular matters as well as religious studies.
2. Of those 25% only 1/3 of them will get funding/subsidies for full time Yeshiva after 3 years in order to become Rabbis/other essential religious professionals. The rest will be expected to work in the workforce.
3. Generally speaking there will not be public transportation on Shabbat in Jewish-majority areas. However, Tel Aviv's Red Line (and subsequent light rail) which is automated light rail will operate and will be free of charge on Shabbat. Essentially this functions like a vertical Sabbath elevator and since it is free there is no actual religious violation. (This policy also encourages the government to build public transit which is needed to alleviate congestion).
4. End the Rabbinate's monopoly over Kosher certifying services and rather have the state regulate the industry, rather than run it. (Not sure if this came into effect but it was proposed in the Bennett-Lapid government). However, the state should recognize the costs to make a restaurant Kosher/Halal and, pursuant to the goal of encouraging workforce-participation among Haredim, give a tax break to restaurants that are Kosher or Halal and workers who work in such establishments.
5. While the Rabbinate can keep its mandate over heterosexual marriages (in part because of the many issues caused by *Mamzerut*), homosexual civil marriage should be allowed.
6. Repeal all of the Judicial reforms. This is consistent with Deuteronomy 16:18. Also blocking Deri from office due to corruption is consistent with Exodus 23:8."

https://preview.redd.it/hpusg6dghufb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4f6b8a40e71420b6bdde083986fa0809a5447e9

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

One of the central verbal fictions we use to make sense of our world is the idea that there is such a thing as “my self"", that there exists a unified entity, stretching over time that can be uniquely identified and referred to.

Calling this concept of “self” a “verbal fiction”, is not intended to imply that it is wrong or invalid. It is as valid as any other verbal framework we use, and perhaps more useful than many other verbal logic conceptual frameworks or perspectives. 

This “self” is composed of many parts represented by different desires, drives and capabilities. A neurologist might say that the single individual we speak of is produced by a host of different clumps of neurons each activated at different times. When we think about ourselves or when we reflect on our own thoughts, we are really thinking about the various activation of these different parts of the brain. 

However, this does not mean that thinking of ourselves or any other person as the totality of the interacting parts is invalid. A molecule is composed of multiple, often different atoms, but nevertheless it is very useful to think of this collection of atoms as a molecule.

Nevertheless, the concept of the self is not just the configuration of the parts of the body or brain at any one time, the way a molecule is a way of thinking of its constituent atoms. We see the “self” as a unifying concept that stretches across time. However, this self changes every second, with every word said, every thought and every new memory. None of us are identical in our physical or mental configuration at any two moments. We evolve, learn and change continuously all the time. We are also very different people in a relationship with one person as opposed to our personality in a different context. The “self” might be a useful concept, but it is a vague one.

The idea that we have some kind of unified and consistent identity across time becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, because our deep emotional attachment to this idea encourages us to behave in a consistent, dependable and similar manner over the course of time. We choose to think and act in such a way that will make sure that this concept of a “self” is never undermined. 

Our interactions with other people also incentivizes us to maintain coherence of behavior across time. We learn very early on that others expect to see more or less the same person each day and so we remake ourselves in the image of that expectation.

The introduction of the written record created one of the most prominent challenges to the concept of the consistent self. We write words that express an opinion, belief, attitude or perspective that truly reflect who we are at the moment that the words are written down. However, once that moment passes, we start changing, but the words remain stuck in time. The written word can be accessed by anybody, including people who know us as someone else, it can even be copied and mass produced.

Today the written word is just one among the ways permanent records are created and immediately distributed. Perhaps the hesitancy we feel about commenting in a public forum is not just a fear of exposure to the unsympathetic other, but panic in the face of being tied to a snapshot of our “self” at just one moment in time. 

Moreover, no sentence carries meaning by itself. Each sentence or assertion needs a lot of other statements in order to be understood or, at least, to allow building more insight into some meaning. Others might try to conjoin words written at different times in order to build a more complete picture. How is this possible when the one who wrote one sentence is no longer the one who wrote the other?

If we were to recognize and abandon our need for consistency, we might free our creativity, but it is equally possible that we might just disintegrate our selves."

So far I’ve learnt a lot about the rules that Orthodox Jews follow which I find fascinating. However, I’d also like to know more about the motivation or convictions behind following these rules with so much dedication. Judaism has a lot of beautiful philosophical wisdom that resonates with me. I’ve heard interesting explanations on concepts of Jewish faith, e.g. marriage being more so a reunion of man and woman instead of an union. I’d love to learn more about the Torah from a Jewish perspective since I read and study the Old Testament too and I’d like to do that more through a Jewish lense if that makes sense.

While the term was used to describe hatred towards Jews, what this Jew had forgotten is that Arabs also happen to be Semites. In his defense though, Arabic is a deserted language **Barely** spoken by anyone, [or so he was probably told](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_land_without_a_people_for_a_people_without_a_land).

&#x200B;

I have no strength to bear up the load of grief generated by this Jewish misfortune. Alas, Jews, Your anti-semtic card can't be played against us, for we are no self-loathing semites.

&#x200B;

Hence, today I shall make a proposition. The West can have anti-Semitism mean whatever they want, but we, fellow Semites, must have our own phrases: 

\- Let Zionism, which challenges the Semites (arab specifically) right to rule the whole of their land, be the term we use to refer to hate towards Arabs.

\- On the other hand, let anti-Zionisim, which opposes the Jewish right to self-determination - *in Palestine*, be the term we use when we refer to hatred towards Jews.

So I tried reading more on that. One of his views was that girls should have a bat mitzvah, which was rejected by other authorities in his community. I think the first one in America was in the middle of the last century, and I'm not sure about other parts of the world. However, nowadays a bat mitzvah seems to be part of orthodox Judaism.

Does that mean, if we read about a ""reform"" Jew or practices from centuries ago, we need to contextualise and consider if that reform actually matches up with today's reform? Could it possibly be considered as orthodoxy from nowadays?"

To summarize a long story I'm a stam ashki east coast jew. I was a baalas teshuva from ages 17-21. I was in shidduchim. I was engaged. Then the pressure of the community, fear of the unknown, doubts about minhagim and halacha and my mesorah and everything else just came crumbling down on me. 

I left my choson (it was for the best, he found and married a his bashert only a few months after we called it off) and all of yiddishkeit at once. 

I moved to a rural area with no jews at all.

Then I started developing a spiritual practice organically. Asking 'God' to help me, guide me, have me do God's will, not my own. 

Over the past year, that belief has grown immensely. My relationship with this 'God' is the central fact of my life. I say Moda Ani and Shacharis here and there. I listen to shiurim on the parshios and would like to keep shabbos again. I moved back to the city and I was considering reaching out to my local chabad.   


However, then the memory of what being in a jewish community really is like comes back. Sitting at a Rabbi's or a family's shabbos tish and feeling out of place. hearing a sermon i dont resonate with. having to dress tznius. I'm married to the most secular of secular jews and he's currently travelling for work for long periods, so.. having to cover my hair. I'm vegetarian, but still, having to keep strict kosher. (To chalav yisroel or not to chalav yisroel?). Mikvah????? The struggle of asking for time off for every single holiday? It seems like way too much, too overwhelming, and it destroyed me when I was doing it.   


And then the thought comes to me ''all this was made up by rabbis over the centuries and is not straight from hashem''.   


But I don't know. I'm confused. I guess I'd like opinions on anyone who is on some type of alternative yiddishkeit spectrum on what they think and how they got there?  
I feel like I love and 100% believe in hashem, daven and am connected all day, and he guides me to do all types of chesedik things that fulfill my life, but then when I think of actual 'halacha', i just feel like i cant.   


Does that even make sense?   
Thanks for reading if you did."

I live in the UK, in an area that outwardly doesn't seem to have a very high jewish population, i certainly couldn't tell you where the nearest synagogue is. That could be totally inaccurate of course, which could  be part of the answer to my question 

Yesterday while shopping I noticed there were a lot of people in what I understand to be Jewish dress, wearing a Kippah, dressed quite formally and with long curls of hair down the sides of their heads. My daughter said she saw more people dressed similarly today in other parts of town. I recall seeing people dressed this way in previous years as well but couldn't say if it was the same time of year. 

Knowing next to nothing about Jewish holidays or periods of importance, and struggling with how to ask in a search engine, I thought i would ask here if there's some sort of significance to this time of year. It could be that these people live here and are simply dressing for an occasion, or it could be that these people are visiting from somewhere else. 

I hope asking hasn't caused any offence, my kids and I were just curious 

Many thanks in advance"

Meanwhile, as explained by in this [terrific video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAOzlinU94g&themeRefresh=1), Israel's enemies - who are also the enemies of all the progress the Jewish state brought to humanity - are lagging behind. Meanwhile friendly countries to Israel like the UAE reached Mars. There is a clear correlation between being friendly to Israel and building a successful science-loving society. While Arabs are in their traditional state of petty religious warfare, antifeminist and antiscientific pro kleptocratic pro fascist headspace, Israelis and Jews are pioneering technology helping people from all around the world, including Arabs, to lead better lifestyles. As Herzl said at the end of his notable essay ""Der Judenstaat""

""Let me repeat once more my opening words: The Jews who wish for a State will have it. We shall live at last as free men on our own soil, and die peacefully in our own homes.

The world will be freed by our liberty, enriched by our wealth, magnified by our greatness.

And whatever we attempt there to accomplish for our own welfare, will react powerfully and beneficially for the good of humanity.""

Despite all the good Jews brought the world, and despite all the negativity Jew haters and Israel haters want to bring to the table, Israel will prevail as a society of progress. Not only are ""Palestinians"" and ""anti zionists' jew haters, but because of their hatred for Israel it's also required for them to hate all the good and progress Israel brought, why must humanity keep subsidizing people who wish to see the progress of humanity halted or go back in time? All they truly deserve is to be punished for opposing one of the only countries in the MENA region with a notable ammount of contributions to the world, instead of cheering on a fellow middle eastern state into being a great nation, Israel has to make do with the fact that its in a neighborhood full of backstabbing neighbors that want to genocide its population since anything is better in their insane eyes than helping Jews reach new heights for the better of humanity."

I am BT since about 2014 - my mother and grandmother weren't religious or even culturally Jewish, so I'm a bit of a black sheep.    


We have a mainstream shul here but it's rapidly falling into disuse after Covid, and I've never really enjoyed going there anyway.  Instead, I daven by the main shul across the river in a somewhat large community of Litvish haredim.  I have done since 2014, but moved away during Covid so didn't resume doing so until this year when I moved back.

It has always been an odd kind of place, you (or I) get the sterotypical 'stone cold Litvak' stare as someone people don't know, and they are naturally very protective - both of their community's way of life and from a security perspective.

I've always fitted in, in a superficial way - I wear a suit, black yarmulke, and a black bent-down hat... or did, until very recently when I started dressing more chassidish on weekdays (I always did on Shabbos).

There was an incident one Shabbos when I had went home after shacharis and somehow put my phone in my pocket before returning for mincha; I felt something as I was outside shul, and took it out - a look of horror swept across my face.  I was of course not the only one to notice, and soon the gossip spread.  Later in the week I was asked if I was actually Jewish because I was seen with a phone on Shabbos, and I explained what happened, and explained my background.  I was encouraged to find a kesubah because I would need one if I am to marry or pursue education there.  I had already been meeting with a Chabad Rabbi who holds the fort at the mainstream shul, but there's not much he can do for me other than offer his support (and, for geirus, a character witness).

In light of this, and to hopefully put people's minds at ease, I wrote a letter to the Kehillah office explaining my situation, that if I didn't find a kesubah I had already acknowledged I would have to go through geirus (I've already been in contact with the Beis Din), and that I was interested in moving into the area, closer to the shul.

So, a couple of weeks went by without incident - I daven mincha & maariv there daily, and everything on Shabbos.

Tisha B'Av came along, I really love Tisha B'Av even though it's such a sad time.  I had just wrapped tefillin for mincha, and was working through korbanos.  A gentleman came over and stood in front of me... ""can you talk?"", he asked.  I continued a couple of lines then paused. ""Yes"", I smiled.

""I want you to know that there are a number of people here who aren't happy about your being here.""

""Oh, erm, why?"", I asked.

""Are you the guy who wrote to the kehalliah office recently?""

""Erm, I did... yes. Is there something wrong?"", I responded.

""Well we phoned they Beis Din and there's no file with your name on it and that's a red line. You shouldn't be here.""

I started trying to explain things, and how they may have me down under my former name (which I included in the letter), before he kept interrupting questioning my status and raising his voice.  By the point, the entire shul was staring and listening.  I asked if we could chat about it after mincha and he said he didn't have time, and began almost shouting at me.

""Should I leave then?"", I asked.,

""Well, that's up to you but there are A NUMBER of people here who aren't happy about you being here including me!""

My heart sank, I began unwrapping my tefillin, packed up and left.  I messaged one of the few friendly faces I know in the kehillah to tell him what happened and he told me to be defiant, to go back and daven - so I did.  My friends on Discord said the same, that I should keep going... but now when I get those 'stoney-faced' looks from people all I can think of is the number of people who don't want me there.

Apparently the guy who pulled me during mincha is a committee member, but he has no authority to tell anyone to leave like that - but the damage is done.  Every time I go to the town and see Litvaks my emotions are a mixture of fear, anger, and perhaps even resentment.  I hoped it would pass, but it hasn't.

I mention they are litvaks because other than bochurim who visit, there are visibly no other chassidic people there - so when they all went home for the summer holidays I was left looking very obvious and very out of place.

The symbolism of this taking place of Tisha B'Av doesn't elude me, and I feel that people like this are why the temple was destroyed in the first place.  I'm fatigued. I was already self-conscious and shy, and now I just dread going there - it has destroyed me.  


There are other minyans, but people tend to move around quite a lot so it's all the same people.  


Incidentally, I have submitted a formal geirus application now as there's a black hole between my great-great-grandparents and my great grand parents -- I've been unable to find evidence to connect them as they came from Ukraine during the pogroms and things seem a bit messy... the Rabbi and Dayanim are in recess over the summer anyway, but now I really don't know if I feel Jewish or feel like I should make the effort anymore. 

I realise one must take the bad with the good, and there are some very good people out there... but this has ruined me.  I'm still so upset about it, even though I thought I was over it - because it really hurts deep.  I tried so hard to fit in here (recent chassidish weekday clothing aside!) and it seems to be all for nothing.  There are no other communities.

My Chabad Rabbi believes if I do have to do geirus it would be best in another city such as Manchester or London where people aren't as uptight, and I do love Manchester... but relocating isn't an option right now.

Thanks for allowing me to rant <3

I have a profressional work meeting next week with an ultra-orthodox Jewish family, two brothers, that I do not know well. About 10 phones calls, normally very business focused but with some interesting small talk too.

The gentlemen are flying into the European city I work in from Jerusalem for a meeting. 

I am not Jewish myself, I come from a western atheist background. I do not know much about the religion if I am honest, just the general holidays in the calendar and the high level basics.

I want to be respectful and helpful to them so I'm graciously asking for advice as how to treat and be around them. Besides of course treating them with the courtesy and respect as I would any of my clients or people I work with.

Are there any cultural tips I can please have?

Is it normal to offer a meal or drinks after a meeting? Is it normal to shake hands? Is it normal to discuss politics, Israel... etc.. Is defining someone as ultra-orthodox an offensive thing?

Is it likely to be very formal down to business or should I expect pleasant small talk and expecting to take them out somewhere nice afterwards? They are essentially visiting to discuss business and a contract we are working on. They are extremely wealthy!

This meeting is super super important for me so any advice very welcome. I want the clients to feel welcome, appreciated and respected!"

1,2023-08-03,Why are we still against electricity on Shabbat?,u/NexexUmbraRs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/15hgafn/why_are_we_still_against_electricity_on_shabbat/,"I'll keep this post concise while addressing the key issues concerning technology on Shabbat. It seems that there are primarily three concerns: Fire, Building, and Writing/Erasing. However, I'd like to present a nuanced perspective that challenges the blanket prohibition of electrical appliances.

Fire: While fire was a more significant concern in the past, modern technology has reduced its impact, mainly limited to incandescent light bulbs and vehicle ignition, which are becoming less problematic.

Building: Comparing completing a circuit to the final blow with a hammer may not be entirely fitting. Completing a circuit is more akin to closing a door or window, and turning on a tap (which also uses electricity) can be seen as merely creating a flow.

Writing/Erasing: Devices with illuminated displays may not necessarily violate the prohibition on writing since these digital representations are not considered real script. Complex halachic nuances are involved here, but for this discussion, we'll focus on the broader impact of electricity.

In summary, there seems to be no compelling reason to prohibit electrical appliances outright, especially given how pervasive technology has become in our lives. Avoiding electricity entirely is increasingly impractical, with faucets and other essential tools relying on it.

Additionally, an overly strict approach to electricity may unintentionally alienate people from Judaism, particularly the younger generation. Many find it challenging to observe Shabbat with such stringent restrictions and may end up disregarding other aspects of Shabbat as well.

It's crucial to reconsider the purpose of a gedar, or fence, in halachic practices. Are the current restrictions on electricity striking the right balance between tradition and modern life? Are we adequately educating individuals about halachot to prevent transgressions without overly burdensome restrictions?

Perhaps it's time to reexamine and update our approach, considering the benefits technology can bring to enhance Shabbat experiences and foster a more inclusive community.

I welcome your insights and thoughts on this matter, and let me know if I've missed any critical points that we should address in further detail."

In Israel, I've been in lots of very frum people's house who don't do any of these. More so, they have a porcelain sink which I learnt you can't kasher.

My apologies if this gets brought up a lot. What do you think about generational trauma/epigenetics as a Jewish person? I just got out of a session with my therapist (a Jewish person recommended to me by a Jewish person) and we talked a fair bit about inherited trauma. It’s come up before in past sessions. I’m an American Ashkenazi Jew who is coming to realize just how much my heritage affects my daily life. The therapist calls it the Shtetl mindset. Past generations and Holocaust survivors in my family affected my upbringing in a big way. Things like a normal misstep on the sidewalk as a child triggering a hyper-concerned, life or death response in my parents. Or accidentally crossing the street a bit too soon. My parents, being raised by survivors, raised me with a lot of fear.

I guess this post is a lot about curiosity regarding your lives. I’m sitting here realizing how the shared-experience of being Jewish has brought me to some of the most amazing and influential people in my life. My mentor/teacher from grad school, friends I met studying with the same teacher, this therapist. I am so grateful for the shared connection, an understanding hard to describe.

personal context for me is i'm an adult from a mixed masorti sephardic & secular ashkenazi american family who was raised non-zionist, whose mom is anti-zionist, and whose grandmother was very zionist. i'm from a very left-leaning major city in the US and was pretty oblivious to israel, period until the second intifada (which occurred when i was a teenager).

because of this background it was really easy for me to be anti-zionist growing up and into adulthood, primarily because i have always resonated the most on a theoretical level with anarchism and socialism, and am highly critical of nationalism in general. but as the elders in my family pass away i've started digging deeply into research about our heritage (syrian jewish specifically as those are the relatives i knew the best), and my feelings about zionism have gotten more and more complex.

the friend group i have now is almost 100% anti-zionist and mostly ashkenazi, and then i also belong to a SWANA community space that isn't jewish and is explicitly anti-zionist/run in part by palestinians. i feel like i have to keep this a secret in both of these spaces, but i'm starting to question my anti-zionism. specifically, i've noticed myself having a lot of questions about how informed about history most of the anti-zionists i know are, and in turn how informed the historical arguments i was making to prop up my own anti-zionsim really were. 

aside from more general political arguments about the situation in the present day that seem pretty factual to me (such as the ""conflict"" being deeply unequal in favor of the israelis & their international allies, israel being an ap\*rtheid state, engaging in g\*nocide, and violating palestinians' human rights, all of which i agree with) i have almost never heard an argument for OR against israel whose attempt to lean on history doesn't make me cringe with its obvious cherrypicking and propaganda. 

like, it's really hard for me to take (almost always ashkenazi) anti-zionists seriously when they argue that jewish culture has virtually nothing to do with jerusalem & EY anymore. it's really hard for me to trust the political analysis of the palestinian friends i have when they have literally no idea that there aren't jews in almost any arab countries anymore, and why. it's really hard for me to trust both camps when they completely ignore and don't mention the active complicity with n\*zism that was happening all over SWANA, including in Jerusalem, during WW II. it's this information, which i didn't know until this year (despite taking several anti-zionist classes about palestine!!!!), that's really made me start questioning things.

with some friends i see how they seem to just... not care about things like learning about the genocides of SWANA jews, while expecting me to put effort into learning about their people's. and while i know anti-zionism is the explanation for my SWANA friends' diffidence, it's hard not to feel a tether to the antisemitism that would have likely propelled their ancestors to say virtually the same things less than 100 years ago. it all makes me wonder, for example, what WOULD have happened to survivors of the h\*locaust & SWANA p\*groms if the israeli state didn't exist, like anti-zionists argue it never should have?

maybe this is misguided (and i would really like to hear respectful counter-arguments if so), but especially given that some of the main opponents of the israeli state prior to its founding were actively collaborating with nazis, how is **especially** SWANA jews seeking to create our own country in our traditional territory, which many of us actually DID have continuous and ongoing access to (if not residency within) during the ottoman empire, anything other than the understood right to self-determination that indigenous & minority groups are recognized to have when under threat? 

the anti-nationalist in me says f--- countries, f--- borders, f--- nationalism. and i wish the world were such that it could be possible for marginalized people to have protected civil rights without nationalism/states. but i think we're seeing the world over that, due to globalization, this just sadly is no longer true (again, i would love to be corrected). and it seems like grace to desire a nation-state is extended (at least by the american left, my context) to virtually all marginalized groups, except jews.

so my questions at the end of all of this are -- do you think there ever could have been a state in palestine/eretz yisrael that, from the beginning, protected both jewish and palestinian civil rights? if yes, how, and what do you view as being the particular political turning point(s) that led this to seemingly being more impossible by the day? 

and looking to the future -- what do you think would happen if, for example, israel ceased illegal settlement activity, was finally prosecuted for war crimes, ended its ap\*rtheid laws, and became a true democracy? do you think the state would continue to exist? what do you think the international response, especially from the arab league, would be?

i want nothing more than to see peace in my lifetime, and to be able to connect with EY without knowing the things i pay for will go in part to funding a military that violates international law. but the more i think over the history, and the more i learn, peace seems vanishingly unlikely. it breaks my heart to know how much palestinians have suffered and are suffering, to feel so alienated from both my ashkenazi and SWANA friends, and to be disgusted by the inevitable nationalism and r\*cism in virtually all pro-israel spaces i know of. i don't think i'll ever be a straight-up zionist, but i'd love to be able to conceptualize any sort of path forwards that genuinely acknowledges and aims to satisfy both sides. 

also... i know i am essentially asking reddit to give me a solution to a major global conflict lol. i'm not expecting miracles. but i would love, at the very least, some good research leads! thanks :-)"

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3cau869vk1gb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9d40005893eb51a8996e96bb5e7eb671c5536ef

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

Opinions about concentrations of power can be broadly divided into three camps, each illustrated here by an extreme example.

Some believe that the root of all societal evils lies in the concentration of power among a select few. They argue that if power were distributed equally among all individuals, much suffering would be eliminated.

Others argue that concentrating power and wealth in the hands of a capable elite is necessary. They justify this by asserting that intervening in market forces is misguided or that humans are inherently irrational and incapable of rational decision-making. They believe that those who understand what is best for society should retain control.

The third view is that the focus power dynamics is misleading, and alternative ways of thinking about the well-being of individuals are needed.

Regardless of which viewpoint one adopts, it is undeniable that throughout history, people have encountered individuals with the power to either help or harm them. Whether it is a king, a foreign ruler, a boss, or a local policeman, when faced with someone wielding power, individuals often hesitate to speak the truth or take direct action. This phenomenon could be called appeasement.

By appeasing those in power and fulfilling at least some of their desires, individuals hope to minimize potential losses that might outweigh the gains resulting from their direct words or actions. Short-term interests and emotional needs of the powerful must be taken into account.

Appeasement strategies can often be rationalized, since multiple conflicting values are at play. Balancing the costs and benefits of probable outcomes in relation to various goals is required. While appeasement may involve compromising on the value of speaking the unvarnished truth, personal well-being is also an important goal.

However, even if appeasement is logically justified, it can be soul destroying. What we do ultimately determines what we become. Each time we suppress the truth, a part of us experiences internal pain. With repeated dishonesty, this internal conflict may fade away entirely.

A group of people always pull in different directions, at least to some extent. However, even a single individual is driven by different values and desires. It may be correct to listen to the logical and rational voice around the table, but there is almost always a price for doing so.

For leaders who feel compelled to resort to dishonesty or compromise values that some group members perceive as surrender, it is worth considering the message their actions convey to their followers.

The outcomes of our actions are not always unpredictable, as there may be unforeseen secondary and tertiary impacts. Compromises made in the short term may lead to further losses in the long run. Conversely, succumbing to immediate moral impulses could be disastrous.

If it is not possible to predict the outcome, it may be better to never allow significant violations of ethical principles. On the other hand, if the consequences of sticking stubbornly to the ethical high ground are pretty clear, appeasement should be swallowed. The great challenge is to figure out which applies when."

Just about to head home after a lovely week in Israel, trying to find some info on how to get to Ben Gurion.

I have a late evening flight tomorrow Saturday 5th. From what I have heard I've got two issues here...

One, it's the sabbath and that means no public transport. Only taxis and sheruts.

Two, I've been told to expect protests tomorrow evening. This could mean delays in getting to the airport.

What's my best course of action here?

Was considering a sherut, can I count on one being available (with a bit of wait time to fill up) at Tel Aviv Central bus station tomorrow?

Also, how much earlier would I have to set off to get through these protests? When do these protests start?

Or am I just better off getting a taxi? If so should I pre book or will Gett do the job for me when I feel its time to go?

Any responses much appreciated, thank you"

I’m in the process of conversion. A couple of days ago, I saw somebody online talking about somebody else who had said “a convert is a Jew, and a Jew is a Jew.” Their response to this was essentially that while converts are halachically Jewish, we won’t ever be the same as ethnic Jews because we don’t have the generational trauma of the Shoah. 

Now, I’ve never, ever seen a convert claim that they have the same understanding of the Shoah as somebody who’s a descendant of survivors. Of course those with a direct connection to the victims are different from those that don’t. That’s not the part that bothers me. What bothers me is using that fact as a counterargument against the fact that converts are as Jewish as born Jews.

As my Rabbi told me, “Judaism is a universe.” Every Jew is different from every other Jew, while also being united in Judaism. The differences between people don’t make any Jew more or less Jewish than any other. This includes an individual’s personal connection or lack thereof to the tragedies of Jewish history.

Should I even be dwelling on this? Is it worth being upset over? Am I wrong entirely?"
1,2023-08-04,I think I'm the world's first Islamic Zionist and I need feedback regarding my plan for peace.,u/omgtow,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/15hvsjt/i_think_im_the_worlds_first_islamic_zionist_and_i/,"Salam alicomb

I'm looking for feedback regarding how I might refine and promote the proposal that I outline below. I would describe my goal as being ""Empire"" to the Jewish diaspora, and as being ""an age of peace and prosperity"" to my Muslim brother and sisters.

I am a 47 year old, Australian Muslim Revert, and Disability Pensioner, and I have nothing better to do with my time, so I am going to spend the rest of my life learning to fly light aircraft and campaigning for peace in the Middle East.

My current plan is that, as soon as I secure a residence in Hobart Australia where I can have nice things and not get robbed by meth heads, I am going to buy an expensive flight simulator rig and start a YouTube, Twitch, and Discord channel through which I will refine and promote my solution.

It would most likely take at least 20 or 30 years to get to the beginning if we started immediately, and it will probably be a couple of years before I have a safe place where I can produce my first video. I believe nonetheless, that my solution to the conflict in Israel/Palestine and to the violence and instability throughout Arabic speaking world at large is realistic. 

I want to engage the Zionist movement to do a complete 180 and start working to both stabilise the governments of North Africa and the Middle East as well as helping their countries move toward, and where applicable, maintain, a first world standard of living, even when oil is no longer a cornerstone of the global economy.

Please share any comments or suggestions that you might have.

**Can someone also please tell me whether or not I can share my Discord link in the sub? I have opted on the side of caution in regards to that to begin with.**

\----------

What follows is a script I have worked up for my YouTube channel's introductory video. It would be narrated over Microsoft Flight Simulator footage of me taking off from Hobart Airport.

\----------

Salam alicomb and shalom brothers and sisters.

My name is Abdul-Rahman Norman, or Norman for short.

Always And Forever (otherwise known as the Arabian Air Force) is a political activist community that seeks to bridge the gap between my Islamic family and our estranged and abusive Jewish cousins.

I think I am the worlds first Islamic Zionist; I seek to encourage the next generation of Muslims to learn from, and for as much as is possible, partner with, the Zionist movement.

I surrender to a one state solution regarding Israel and Palestine and believe that Israel should stop building settlements and finally end the conflict by uniting the region as one country and recognising all citizens.

I have a plan that I hope will gain popularity and bring an era of peace to the Middle East that might last at least until Al-Aqsa Mosque is thrown down.

Both sides would pay a heavy price in blood, but Palestine is no longer a viable state, and I propose that Israel annex what remains of the country.

After that, and with the help of Saudi Arabia, I propose that they co-found a new diplomatic state and monetary union, composed initially of those two countries.

The new state would be akin to the European Union, and might be known as the ""Arabian Union"" or alternatively ""Zion"".

Having the safety of Al-Aqsa Mosque enshrined in both the new Israeli and Arabian Union constitutions, is in my estimation the biggest single chip that the Islamic community could negotiate for.

The much celebrated US constitution, is however, in my opinion, largely outdated and counterproductive, and I suggest that a method be laid down by which the constitutions of the Arabian Union, and all its member states, are required to be redrafted every 100 years.

That would mean that Jewish fundamentalists would have to accept that the Dome of the Rock was off the table for at least 100 years, rather than for once and for always.

The aim would be to expand Zion to include all Arabic speaking countries, and to seek to counter the political interests of both China and the USA, as well as those of the European powers, Turkiye, and Iran.

I promote that new parliaments, like those in Scotland and Wales, be created in Gaza and the West Bank.

That Israel conscript all healthy male youth from Gaza, and give them the option of swearing allegiance to Israel, and serving one or two years in a unit equivalent to the Scots Guard, or alternatively spending the same period of time engaged in hard labour.

That Israel should likewise conscript all healthy young men from the West Bank, and with them form a unit equivalent to the Welsh Guard under the same terms and conditions.

There could be two national languages in the Arabian Union; Arabic and Hebrew, and it could be mandated that, outside of Mecca and Medina, all signage must be written in both languages.

I would propose that the Islamic Capital of Zion be Mecca, while the Capital itself be Jerusalem, and that the Union's Central Bank be located in Jerusalem also.

I think it unseemly however that the Israeli Capital, and the Knesset, be located in the Arabian Union's Capital, and I suggest that they be relocated to Tel Aviv; I leave it open to discussion as to what the new Arabian currency would be called.

Finally, due to being vastly outnumbered by the Islamic members of the Union, I would propose that Israel would have the only veto in the Arabian parliament.

If you want to help me promote and refine this solution for peace in the Middle East, or just come fly simulators with me, please join me on Discord.

I’m very curious if any of my ancestors were Jewish as despite being Brazilian my whole family came from Europe (German, Italy, Portugual, French, etc) and so I wonder if I’m related to any of the lost tribes

 Sure, arguably they needed somewhere centralized after the Holocaust, but why did it need to be that particular area? Sure, it's a holy land to them, but the Palestinians had reasons for being there as well and using that as the justification is basically saying you think Judaism is inherently more valid than Islam. Since Jerusalem is important to Christians, would a large enough group of Christians be justified in invading Israel and taking it for their own just because it's important to them too, doing to the Jews in Israel exactly what they did to the Palestinians, for the same kind of reason?

 I don't think being victims of something like the Holocaust makes you entitled to treat someone else so inhumanely either. You can make an argument off of the same kind of logic that because the American pilgrims fled religious persecution from Europe that this justifies manifest destiny. Sure the Holocaust was worse but no amount of unfair treatment you've gone through entitles you to victimize a different group of Innocents just because you feel entitled to what they have."

A new law, with bipartisan support, has recently been passed by the Israeli Knesset doubling the time served by a Sexual abuser if they are found to have committed the rape/abuse with ""nationalistic intent"". The nominally indiscriminate law has drawn alot of criticism. 

As might be expected, Israeli HR organisations and Palestinian groups are worried that this will be used exclusively to target Palestinians who have abused Jewish women. A sentiment seemingly justified during a debate on the law two weeks ago, when a member of the Knesset, Son Har-Melech, said the bill provides ""proper and correct treatment to female Jewish victims"".

""It can't be the case that the honour of Jewish women is violated by miscreants who get away with no or ridiculous punishments,"" she said.

Seemingly proving the intent of the law was to be applied for specifically Jewish victims, and Palestinian/Arab perpetrator's. If true, this would represent blatant discrimination and bigotry against Arab citizens. Who, when committing the same crime, could be given different punishments. Ofcourse every rapist deserves to rot in jail, equally, whether Jewish or Arab. However this sort of rhetoric, and law, comes across as racist for the simple fact that it would be applied solely against one racial group. Especially since rights groups are denouncing government and minister claims that ""nationalisticly motivated"" rape is a specific genuine issue. 

My question, then, is whether their are genuine such cases of this  ""nationalistic rape"". How was that found, how would it be proven in future cases. Do you think it would be more likely that Palestinians/Arabs would be convicted of this specific crime, moreso than Jews. Are their any international parallels. I would like more information in general about Sexual abuse supposedly being used as part of terrorist or national goals and how common it might be in Israel. Without any proof of a genuine issue, it seems more likely that this is yet another law which is going to be used, if not explicitly, to treat Arabs/Palestinians differently to Jews on the basis of their ethnicity."

The most obvious choices are Egypt and Jordan. Egypt can contribute a small percentage of the Sinai- this would allow Gaza to extend into their territory. Jordan could contribute land adjacent Jordan River, which would extend the West Bank territory.  

For size comparison, 
Sinai peninsula is 23,000 square miles.
Gaza Strip is 140 sq miles. Imagine if just one percent of Sinai was contributed to the cause. 

Jordan is 34k square miles, and West Bank is 2.2k square miles. Jordan  can contribute a chunk of land on the east bank of the river (which is mostly farm/desert land), it could make a considerable difference. Considering the population size in Israel/Palestinian territories, expansion for both parties is almost a necessity. 

It’s important to remember that the current borders for Egypt and Jordan are 20th century inventions. Of course realistically neither country would agree to such a sacrifice. However if are to consider the history of this conflict both countries have been major parties to it and they should certainly feel obligated to help end it. They would also benefit immensely from an end to the conflict, which could spell unprecedented economic growth for the region."

But that is not enough they also have to settle in Europe and America. They have massive amounts of power across the world and their religion Islam is one of the biggest.

And yet somehow that is not enough for them. They want to utterly destroy the only jewish state even though historically they have oppressed jews before israel was even made. But they also want europe to cater to them and their sharia law and they attack and rape and kill jews and christians in europe and america. Speaking of america in there Rashida and Ilhan make things unsafe for American Jews by encouraging attacks while claiming to just be anti-Israel while upholding privileged Muslims as victims of ""muh islamophobia"".

In summary antizionists are one of the most disgustingly privileged ideologies to ever exist and they are simply evil. No wonder people across the world are getting tired of them. They are very lucky that many zionists are more compassionate then I am because I would end this with mass deportations so that even if israel falls the jews can be safe in Europe from antizionist and Palestinian violence."

What few socials I had I deleted years ago because of all the politics and hate.

There was one on TikTok who said that she believed that ‘Yeshua (Jesus) is king’ while also doing things like celebrating Purim, she would say things like ‘Deuteronomy 28 was describing Africans (no I’m not joking) and also said that Shabbat was on Saturday only and didn’t begin Friday night. It’s so incredibly annoying how someone could be so ignorant, arrogant, idiotic, and hypocritical at the same time. I’m pretty sure this is just cultural appropriation mixed in with some racism but it’s so dumb that I get mad when BHIs take my peoples traditions and culture and appropriate it as their own while also saying that we stole it from them.

1. What does he mean by it preceded creation? 

2. Is it common for Jewish people to see the Sabbath in this way? 

3. What does the last bit mean from the quote? ""it is all of the spirit that the world can bear. ""

Ok, that's it for now. I'm just starting the book but really enjoying it. It is compact and elegant.

I’m here today to talk about this thing ive been researching for a long time now , imma keep it short for all of the readers. 

So last year ive heard that my family roots is jewish like deeply jewish but me , my father and his father maybe some generation are all (Muslims) anyway I started searching about my family history and past and came across the Expulsion of Jews from Spain and when reading the story ive noticed that this group called sephardic jews escaped all around the world but there was a large group that went to Aleppo , Syria in which is where I’m from , anyway my great great grandfather had some clothes that had some jewish symbols which I believe is passed from generation to generation in our family, my dad doesn’t know anything about this but my grandfather lived in a neighborhood with a lot of jewish people, in fact my great grandfather died protecting a jewish family which all of them were girls from someone trying to break into their house . And my name is (Hashem) which is a jewish name and my previous generation grandfather was named Hashem too i searched for my last name on ancestry and 99% of them came back as jewish literally so i did some searching and found something called the Come back law i think which is basically enables Sephardic Jews who are descendents of those expelled from Spain in the 15th century to obtain the Spanish citizenship without renouncing their current citizenship and without requiring residency in Spain and portugal . So could someone help me with this im still in Syria till this day and tbh i want to get out and my dream destination is Spain , how can i work this out ? I even started learning Hebrew when i knew i had a jewish background lol I’m too invested 

Thank you"

Well I took this and ran with it for almost 20 years. 

 When I looked at the evidence of my research there is a shirt-tail relative that was (allegedly) a Rabbi, but there is no hard evidence of that. Now also considering my Nana having emotional issues, and gaslighting issues (which I know now that I'm older), this has really shaken my faith a bit, because, well , no one bothered to correct me. Which makes me feel awful for perpetuating such a thing (a lie). I'm wondering what to do now? (FYI not the best Jewish person but I tried somewhat).    "

Why this ""narrow"" ban was applied to all mixing of dairy and meat but not to all situations when you can use ""related"" animals or their produce to cook another. You can't butter baste steak but you can fry it on beef tallow. You can't marinate chicken in yoghurt, but you can add eggs to chicken meatballs?

Non of them ate pork, they would even be careful of sneaky pork like gelatin gummy bears and veggies cooked in bacon grease. However they wouldn’t hesitate to eat a cheeseburger or shrimp. So it’s not like they were kosher. It also seems like everyone associates Jews with not eating pork. However the same isn’t true for other non-kosher foods. I wonder how and why pork became the main sticking point as something Jews shouldn’t eat more so than other non-kosher foods? I didn’t even know about the not mixing meat and dairy or no shellfish aspect of kosher until I started studying Judaism."

Just looking for some advice here. I’ve started going to services at a local synagogue and was able to meet with the rabbi for a 1-on-1 session. Everyone I’ve talked to is so nice and helpful but there’s one problem. In larger group settings, I feel very awkward and out of place. I don’t know/have anyone to go to or hang out near or talk to. I’m rather new still, so obviously it will take time but I find it difficult to approach groups of people or try talking to new people. 

Maybe I need to be a little more patient and keep showing up for events and stuff. Maybe I need to try talking more to others. Usually kabbalat Shabbat services are smaller than the Saturday morning so it’s easier for me to talk to people, but usually at the end of the service when everything dissolves and people start doing their own thing I just don’t know how to fit myself in.

Any advice, tips or suggestions? I hope this makes sense. Thank you in advance."

First off, I am not Jewish, nor am I from Israel or Palestine. I am an American Muslim and as a general part of the American Muslim community, we have certain rules. One of them is that we dont preach hate or encourage violence. While we do sympathize and pray for those who are suffering no matter where in the world they are, it does not mean our leaders are allowed hate speech of any sort. That is generally the rule. Does everyone follow these rules? No. 

I went to an Islamic Center (I can assure you, it is only called that, it is run by an idiot) for Friday prayer and the guy that owns the place is Palestinian. He just realized at the age of 50 that he needs to practice the religion of his forefathers and to get in touch with his Palestinian roots. I get that, but he is aggressive about it, in a way where its WRONG. He shows video clips of the Palestinians and recently went on a rant about Jenin, Palestine and talks often about ""Oh man, I wish I could go fight with them because you know I dont play"", and encourages the few people that actually come to pray there to ""join the fight"". This is not something American Muslims are used to and when it happens, it is shocking. All I can say is that people leave this place and do not come back for another prayer. 

I'm posting here to ask you guys how you deal with it. We have our own set of problems to deal with, but what do you do when someone is actively encouraging the congregation to go join a fight in a country we basically have nothing to do with. The general rule is to mind your own business and be loyal to the country that you are living in. I have talked to the police about this, but I'm not sure what else I can do. I cant talk to him, you cant talk to someone that goes on rants like a psycho. I dont go there or show any support anymore.  So, what do you guys advise? 

Btw, this place is called AUCC Academy in Teaneck NJ if anyone wants to leave a nice google review to warn others, because we do have Jewish friends come in time to time for events who have no idea what's going on when they arent around.

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

Almost any concept can be broken down into its component parts. Here’s how to play this trick:

Start with a random word and then write down a few related words that come to mind. Just let your thoughts flow freely and create a short list. Then, imagine the original word without each related word.

Here are a few examples: Tree without leaves. Lake without water. World without clouds. Ball without roundness. 2 but not 1 + 1. Skyscraper without height. House without occupants. Occupants without a house. Mountain without a peak. Garden without flowers. Library without books. Rainbow without colors. Music without melody. Science without curiosity. Writer without words. Time without change. Whisper without sound. Journey without a destination. Chess without strategy. Mirror without reflection. Sculpture without form. Language without meaning. Candle without flame. Ocean without depth. Bridge without support. Camera without a lens. Butterfly without wings. Fire without heat. Mountain range without valleys. Invention without purpose. You get the idea.

Words come in clusters but any such cluster can be pulled apart. The results can be interesting and can spark creative new ways of thinking. We often don't consider that a cluster can be pulled apart, but these limitations are self-imposed. They are the chains that confine our minds, but they are also the walls of the cup that hold the water of our mind.

A repeatable tool is quite exciting. There are other similar techniques, such as combining two random words or breaking down a text into a list of assertions and asking which is novel. Simply apply the same procedure to as many subjects as you can imagine. We may dismiss this repetition with the saying, ""to a person with a hammer, everything looks like a nail."" However, let's not forget the excitement of embarking on a journey with a new tool, with endless possibilities awaiting exploration. Just imagine the thrill that explorers experienced when ocean-crossing ships were first created, opening up a world ready to be discovered.

The challenge lies in the fact that the total number of combinations of unusual thoughts is almost infinite. Most of these paths have no value, unless we ask ourselves, ""What is value?"" They are like mining for silver deep underground. Human knowledge, as a whole, resemble the veins of silver in a mine that have already been discovered. You can explore near the richest veins and you might find more silver. You can also venture into new directions and discover new veins. However, in most directions, all you will encounter is rock.

Perhaps a more promising strategy than random dissociation is to dissect two ideas and then carefully examine how each component of the concept survives and interacts with the world. This way, you have a tool for exploring each component, one that could deepen your understanding of both sides."

In Turkey and Hungary, the autocrat sold his vision by wrapping his agenda under an economic guise. In Israel, it is unusually the case that the same trajectory is happening but this time the autocrat sells his story  in judicial rather than economical terms.

Shimshon
Came to prominence under Philistine oppression (Judges 13:1)
Killed a lion(Judges 14:5-6)
Killed Philistines to pay price for a riddle during his marriage feast(Judges 14:10-20)
His wife was given to a Philistinese during his absence(Judges 15:2)
Returns to claim back his wife(Judges 15:1)
He becomes a judge of Israel(Judges 15:20)

King David
Came to prominence during a battle with the Philistines(1 Samuel 17:1)
Killed a lion(1 Samuel 17:34-35)
Killed Philistines to pay bride price(1 Samuel 18:27)
His wife was given to a Philistinese when he was on the run from Saul(2 Samuel 3:14-15)
Claimed back his wife after he ascended the throne(2 Samuel 3:14)

4) Said Jewish terrorists are visited in hospital by their political patrons from the Knesset. Literally, politicians are somehow allowed to visit a murder suspect who is under investigation. Absolute lawlessness and zero concern for protocol or the purity of the investigation.

5) The tormenter of the Jewish state, Benjamin Netanyahu, decides now would be a good time to let the public know (through an American medium of course) that he will absolutely bulldoze through legislation handing him control of the Judaical appointment committee.

I hope you're all doing well! Today, I find myself seeking some advice on a personal matter. I'm a 27-year-old male with an arab/amazigh heritage; my father's side is Arab, and my mother's side is from the Rif mountains. Although my family practices Islam, I personally don't follow any religious beliefs.

Recently, I've been captivated by a Jewish Moroccan girl who has caught my eye. She is truly enchanting 🫀

However, I have some reservations about approaching her, given the potential cultural and religious differences between us.

Do Jews in Morocco date Moroccans with Arabic backgrounds?

I haven't directly asked her out yet because I don't want to look uncultured. Before taking any steps, I wish to gather insights, advice, or hear from those who may have had similar experiences.

If any of you have valuable input or personal experiences to share, I would be immensely grateful. Your support and guidance mean a lot to me as I navigate this unfamiliar situation.

Thank you in advance !"

שלום רב,
אף שידוע לנו שמתג (=געיה) זו הטעמה משנית, במסורת תימן המימוש של המתג הוא בדיוק כמו מימוש של טעם.
אין הבדל למשל אם המילה מאזני (בצירוף ""מאזני צדק"") מוטעמת מלעיל באות מ""ם (מפני נסוג אחור) או אם היא מוטעמת מלרע באות נו""ן, ומתחת האות מ""ם יש מתג. בשניהם המ""ם תוטעם באותו האופן בדיוק.
נראה שה""שיבוש"" הזה הגיע למסורת תימן מפני שבתחילה הם היו אמונים על מסורת בבל, ושם אין מתגים כידוע. וכשקיבלו כתבי יד טברניים (עם מתגים) ועברו למסורת הטברנית, לא ידעו אין לבטא את המתגים החדשים שנמצאו בכתבי היד הטברניים (בדיוק כמו שלא ידוע איך לבטא את הסגול, ואיך לבצע את הטעמים המחברים וכדו' - שאינם קיימים במסורת בבל).

ידוע שיש געיה קלה וגעיה כבדה. השווא יהיה נע רק לאחר געיה קלה. לאחר געיה כבדה הוא יהיה נח. הבעיה שהגעיה הקלה לא תמיד מסומנת, ולכן לא ניתן לומר שכל שווא שאחרי געיה הוא נע. כאמור, לפעמים אין געיא - והשווא יהיה נע; ולפעמים יש געיה - והשווא יהיה נח.
לכן בנושאים האלה יש כל מיני מחלוקות פנים-תימניות, ויש מסורות שונות.
בהצלחה"

* 20 or less religious Jews just so happened to enter private Palestinian property (the lawyer actually claimed there’s basically no such thing as private Palestinian property because this happened in Area C) to herd sheep across the hills one hour before Sabbath at a distance where they were not at all guaranteed to return home and pen the sheep in time. 
* They were then attacked, entirely unprovoked, by a horde of no less than **200-300** (yes, really) Arabs intent on lynching them, shouting “Yitbakh al yahud” and armed with rocks and firecrackers.
* Despite outnumbering the good settlers 15 to 1, the forces of evil failed to hurt a single person other than the one who just so happened to have brought a gun, at which point he, now grievously wounded, used it in justified self defense and neutralized the Arab terrorist. 
* The suspect dropped the handgun but his friends picked it up to ensure that the Palestinians (and *not* the police, not at all) couldn’t get their hands on it. 

Add to this the fact that the suspect has a history of calling for violence against Arabs on social media, including supporting the events in Huwara, and I have to ask, is *anyone* really buying this bullshit? Are the right wingers supporting him just pretending? Is their bias against Arabs so strong that they would buy a story that reads like the creation of a drug-addled 4 y/o? 

People are saying “we don’t know what really happened, wait for the investigation to finish”, but **a)** they have never asked to give the same  leeway when the roles were reversed (when was the last time you saw a right winger argue that an Arab car ramming might have just been a road accident?), and **b)** we are already seeing attempts to sabotage the investigation by members of the Knesset abusing their immunity to visit and have private conversations with the main suspect, totally not helping him match his story to everyone else’s. 

When was the last time you heard of an arrested murder/manslaughter suspect getting visitations two days after the event and before being investigated for the first time?"

But I'm not sure it would be appropriate to attend my school's Chabad/Hillel, and pass myself off as a Jew.

Some context, my mother was adopted into a family with a Jewish father and a Christian mother. Recently, she opened the adoption records, and learned her biological parents (my maternal grandparents) were both Jewish.

I've also grown up in a strongly Jewish community, and celebrated Jewish holidays as a kid. Jewish communities feel like a second home to me.

But I've never attended temple. I don't speak Hebrew. I don't know the prayers and songs. And I'm agnostic, which would obviously preclude be from being truly religiously Jewish. When I compare myself to my devout Jewish friends, it's clear that I've had a vastly different experience.

How should I go about this? Would it be dishonest to consider myself and introduce myself to others as Jewish? Should I instead consider myself a 'Jew-adjacent' observer? I would appreciate any thoughts or advice."

A new Haaretz article dated Aug. 7, 2023, seeks to display the settlers in the West Bank as provocateurs who seek confrontation with Arabic Palestinians living near and around new Israeli settlements.


Main points for discussion: 

“In January 2022, when Israel was still under the rule of the “change” government, the Civil Administration razed five of the outpost’s buildings and evacuated the occupants. Several months later, settlers returned to the site”

< continuation below >

“Between March and May of this year, the Civil Administration discovered 13 new buildings there. By then, the current government was in power and the person in sole charge of settlement activity in the West Bank was Minister in the Defense Ministry Bezalel Smotrich” 

“Their method is well-known: Create provocations by sending out patrols, often armed, to the outskirts of the Arab villages. These activities have the dual purpose of deterring Palestinians and of establishing future claims (usually unfounded) to land.”

Questions for discussion:

What is the solution to help curb and eventually end the settlement of the West Bank. The practice isn’t sustainable, and continues to harm Israeli pushes toward peace and stability as well as security among its Arab neighbours. Should the Israeli government completely abandon those whom have settled in the West Bank? Should Israel forcefully withdraw settlers, a practice reminiscent of the withdrawal from Sinai? albeit on a smaller scale than what would be required now. Does there need to be a bigger push for justice to ensure these Ultra-Orthodox face justice? How viable is any of this under the current government?"

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

When anyone gives us orders, telling us to do something, we often feel like our freedom is being undermined, even our sense of worth as human beings. We learned our first line of defense against such an assault when we were very young; when an adult gives a command, we can always respond with the question: ""Why?""

The interaction between the order, the emotions, and the demand for an explanation is worth analyzing.

If the only reason for taking an action is that someone else wants it, because they ""said so,"" then obeying such an order implies that the other person has higher ""worth"" than we do, that their desires supersede our own, and we are less free than they are. However, if there is a reason that explains why we should take that action, then the interpersonal element is dissolved and all these reasons for refusing might disappear.

The explanation given for the action must come in the form of a rule. The rule must have a generalized component that applies to more than one person, at more than one time and in a variety of circumstances.

For example, if someone tells us that we must eat an apple, it would not be sufficient to provide a rule that says ""Whenever a person is called John Smith, the time is 2:30pm on the 7th of August 2023, at GPS location X, they must eat an apple."" That may have a similar syntax to other rules, but it is missing the generality that might make the difference between an arbitrary order and a grounded reason.

This requirement that externally required actions be dictated by some rule does not settle the questions of justification, freedom, fairness, or equality. The rule itself might be unjustified, arbitrary, unfair, undemocratic, or flawed in some other way. This requirement that rules have generality is a necessary condition for overriding some impulsive, spontaneous desire of our own, but it is not a sufficient condition.

There is not always a clear distinction between arbitrary requirements and general rules. The rule might appear to be general but in practice, we might be the only one, or one of a very small and arbitrary group, that is limited by the rule. It is sometimes worth considering when faced with some onerous requirement whether we are, in fact, being targeted by what only looks like a general rule.

This strategy for reconsidering any requirement need not be limited to direct orders. Sometimes the targeting can have a more subtle dimension, leaving us with a feeling that our life is scripted by others, even if no explicit orders were given. Whenever we make a decision, we should always ask who, really, is making the decision."

I was ffb, and I always struggled with the idea of god in High school - I just didn't like the way religious people seemed to have elitism, and the way pple looked down on Gay Jews. 

I got married at 20 while I was religious, and we didn't date shomer - she was my first gf I ever did anything with and I really appreciated that she was my first. 

During the marriage, I became athiest, but I always was talking to rabbis about my issues with Judaism and trying to find answers that I was comfortable with. I just couldn't find anything that made me feel comfortable

After the divorce, I was broken. I found peace and love through Buddhist ideas, talking with rabbis, Hindu gurus, and many other sources. 

I moved to Israel and I found an amazing friend group and made tons of new friends. It's honestly a miracle how well things worked out. I feel so blessed and loved - there HAS to be a God. 

I believe that Hashem created ALL religions as means to connecting to him, and we the Jewish people have a special connection with him and the Torah.

I have been praying everyday and putting on tefflin for the past 3 months, and I'm excited everyday to do it! I never ONCE felt like this all my life. 

I have fallen in love with being religious like I never have before! I'm so happy with the relationship I am building with God - I see the beauty in all the mitzvot and the traditions that chazal made for us. 

I feel like hashem needed me to expirance the divorce and the pain so I would find my own individual path towards him. I'm grateful that it happened, and I'm happy with the amount of growth I have done after the divorce.

Here's my problem - it's been 6 months since the divorce, and I feel like I have really grieved the relationship, and I understand what part I played in the ending of the marriage, I understand that I made alot of mistakes and I have taken steps to rectify those mistakes

I want to start dating, because I want to create and beautiful family that practices Judaism, but understands that every human was created in god's image - and even non Jews have a connection to hashem, and we shouldnt look down on them, or anyone who is different from us

The thing is, I think I want to date Shomer, because I really like how serious everyone takes those dates. I want to make sure that me and my next wife have that intellectual and emotional connection before we bring the physical to the table

I have a few concerns, 1) is it possible to date Shomer and then not have good sexual chemistry? I would hate it if I married a women who I loved for everything she had inside her soul, but we didn't connect sexually, sexual chemistry is an important part of a marriage

2) I know Shomer dating is usually pretty fast-paced, like  4-6 months - so I am scared that I may not ""know"" her well enough after those months, especially after being divorced, it's scary to jump into a marriage after such little time ( I dated my ex for 2 years before we got married)

3) although I feel ready to date, Im only 6 months post divorce - so if I met someone amazing and we did date Shomer, we would be married only a little after a year after my divorce - that feels too soon but idk. 

I am thinking that maybe I should not date Shomer, and maybe save one sex for marriage , while accepting cuddling/handholding/kissing while we date. That way I can date the women for a longer time, while keeping the sexual intamacy lower. 

Open to any thoughts or advice, I really want my next marriage to be done right, and in the way that hashem wants it to be done, but I want to feel like I am being responsible and not rushing into anything because I want to start a family.

There are a couple different things I found in books I read about The Rebbe that I'm curious about:

* In ""Toward a Meaningful Life"", The Rebbe is described as being very wise, and giving great advice based on his understanding of the Torah and through study and being a spiritual person.
* In ""To Know and To Care"", they bring it to another level. They start off with an example where someone was contacting the Rebbe because doctors were telling some parents their kids needed surgery. Without even talking to the Rebbe, the receptionist of the Rebbe passed on his message that the child should not be sent to surgery and they will get better, miraculously. The book kind of goes on and on with examples like this were the Rebbe told someone to do something that seemed like it would be wrong, but in retrospect became an unlikely miracle.

I've also read that some Chabad people also think that The Rebbe was the literal messiah, and maybe that's more like what the latter book was aimed at?

I'm not trying to raise any controversy, I'm just trying to contextualize, as someone new to practicing the faith, what I'm reading. Is the former book more mainstream and the latter more messianic? Or, does G-d really work in day to day miracles like that where a holy person tells you to do something that seems wrong, and you should go ahead because it will turn out for the best?

It's widely acknowledged that Arab countries have faced human rights issues and mistreatment of ethnic minorities. The actions of some Gulf Arab states have caused destabilization in various nations, including Somalia.

 However, it's concerning how the focus shifts when similar actions involve Jews, with heightened attention and criticism. Personally, I'm not a supporter of Israel, but the evident double standards concerning Jews are baffling and rarely addressed. 

I recently discussed this with a Qatari individual who eventually blocked me. Similarly, during a conversation with an Algerian, I encountered justification for the troubling treatment of blacks in Algeria.

They treated Jews like second class citizens and when Jews didn’t want to be treated like that, they aped out and jews rocked your asses in a 4v1.

now they continuously treat blacks and migrants workers from South Asia the same way they treated Jews."

Thoughts?,u/123burner-,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/15kighb/intermarriage_is_bad_thoughts/,"In the last couple of days, I have seen extremely disturbing posts and comments. There seems to be a large contingent of people in this sub, who believe that it is totally acceptable to intermarry and whom are willing to not only intermarry themselves but to give advice to fine Jews as to how they can attract, date and marry Jews. I am just curious how you all feel as though you can justify that, given that intermarriage is the number one threat to Jews in the entire world. Within only a couple of generations, we will have a Jewish population in the US less that 2 million. And I know a lot of you are going to discuss patrilineal, descent, or whatever, but the statistic show pretty unilaterally that parents it’s very hard to remain Jewish and have Jewish children. This is all in my view extremely shameful but I am curious how people in this sub can justify intermarriage."

I'm originally from Australia, but have lived in Israel for 4 years or so. I've also live in a few European countries before moving here, so I've always been aware about recycling, keeping public areas clean, harm of single use plastics etc.

I know there have been a few posts here before about the rubbish/trash and littering problem in Israel. It honestly makes me extremely angry that the county is so heavily littered and in some places looks like a rubbish dump site. 

I regularly participate in local beach cleanups, or clean around the block sometimes. I've tried submitting complaints, emails etc to local councils about litter issues, areas with lots of trash, but they never seem to care/reply. 

As a non-native I'm looking for solutions on how to solve this issue and get the national attention it deserves? 

Petitions, mass emails to councils, governments regarding cleanup campaigns, pushing for enforcement on litterbugs? 

There's a huge community here, and I'm curious to see how many people would back such actions."
1,2023-08-07,Pro-Palestinianism: Context-free from the river to the sea,u/thermonuclear_pickle,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/15kkzx5/propalestinianism_contextfree_from_the_river_to/,"Apartheid 101:

* It has a very specific context. That context is the legal discrimination against your own citizens within your own borders.
* It has the additional specific history of being a powerful minority stratifying structures against a disempowered minority.
* Discrimination has to rise to the level of apartheid. Discrimination in law that disadvantages a group is not necessarily apartheid.

&#x200B;

Lets tackle the points above one by one. 

# Context

Palestinians and their supporters love to expand the context of apartheid by ignoring it. Why?

Because if you ignore context, then everything is the worst it can be. But it doesn't work that way. Here are some examples:

**Murder**

Defined as the act of killing, with intent. If you're not careful with context and do not allow for expansion of the definition, you forget that there are things such as justifiable homicide, and when you kill people for work - i.e. when you're a soldier.

**Parasite**

A parasite is an organism that lives on or in an organism of another species, known as the host, from the body of which it obtains nutriment. If you're not careful, that definition includes normal intra-species reproduction. IE you could by that definition call a human foetus, a parasite.

\---

Context matters. So why do pro-/Palestinians ignore it in the slur of apartheid? Well there are three reasons:

* Their own ignorance.
* Our (i.e. their opposition) ignorance in calling out their logic flaws.
* There's no agreed upon definition of apartheid.

Here's the logic flaw of apatheid, vis-a-vis Israel, explained in bullet points:

* Israel *definitely* has laws that disadvantage minorities - such as 1:1 marriage, with no allowance for Muslim 1:4 marriages. This does not rise to the level of apartheid because it is a law for all, even though it will affect some more than most.
* There is no such thing as extraterritorial apartheid - there is no country in the world that can apply its own laws to 3rd territories - even if occupied. This is because the act of applying your laws to a territory, is called annexation - and it's illegal.
* In fact taking the point above, and expanding it, [Article 49](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/gciv-1949/article-49) of the Fourth Geneva Convention allows anything up to indirect ethnic cleansing for security reasons and [Article 64](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/gciv-1949/article-64) mandates separate legal systems in occupied territory. 
   * In essence if we take apartheid to be illegal, then Articles 49 and 64 cannot possibly exist and be valid. It gets worse if this point is true vis-a-vis occupied territory.
      * If apartheid is illegal & Articles 49 & 64 are illegal *then every occupation* must become an annexation
      * If every occupation becomes an annexation, we do not need the Fourth Geneva Convention to regulate occupations.
   * On the other hand, if Articles 49 and 64 do exist and are valid, then apartheid in occupied territory can't be illegal.

The only way out of this logical conundrum is accepting the contextual logic that apartheid cannot apply to occupied territory. And it's that logical conundrum that pro-Pals and their supporters refuse to acknowledge... yes even HRW, Amnesty, etc. 

None of them wrestle with this complex point because to do so would create a logical minefield that they could never cross.

So what are we left with?

# Stratifying Structures & ""rising to the level of apartheid""

It is unarguable that Jews have most of the power in Israel. It is unarguable that there is a level of systemic racism against Israeli Arabs. It is likewise unarguable that among Israeli Arabs there is a level cultural racism against Jews.

Does this rise to the level of apartheid? Well... arguably not because there are no laws in Israel targeting Arabs and disempowering them.

Yes, it might be disadvantageous being an Arab... but try being a black person in USA, a Roma in Europe, a Basque in Spain, etc. If you are any of these, you face some level of racism, some level if disenfranchisement and possibly some level of otherness - but we simply do not define that as apartheid - it does not rise to a high enough bar. Arabs in Israel face probably better perspectives than any of the other examples.

Moreover, unlike South Africa... there simply isn't a Jewish minority lording over an Arab majority within Israel. There's a Jewish majority.

My grandmother, his son, is still alive but knows nothing but his birthday and name. She doesn’t have any of his legal documents and doesn’t know his Teudat Zehut. 

I’m trying to obtain his death certificate for citizenship purposes (not israeli), but the israeli consulate told me only my grandmother could request it, which is fine by me. Except that none of us know his teudat zehut number. What can we do if we don’t have his number, how do we find it if it’s absolutely mandatory, or are we f*cked regardless? 

The consulate said we can’t request the certificate without his teudat zehut number. It’s kind of ludicrous to me that his own daughter can’t request it without having his ID number which she wouldn’t know as she didn’t even know her father after 4 y/o."

The driving appears to go off of: “the rules may exist but screw then” it feels quite chaotic but a controlled chaotic.

The people I’ve encountered so far, granted one was Chabad, have been friendly and haven’t felt like I’m an outsider. A stranger including the member of Chabad despite our language barrier was willing to help me get transport to the hotel which gave a spring in my step.

The food on the beachfront…how do you guys afford any of it?????? Nearly 100 shekels for a chicken burger at a waterfront place. I’ve been given a list of cheap places to eat so fine for food but still the prices on the beachfront 😭😭

Security was legitimately the easiest part for me. Didn’t have to wait hours. Didn’t have to answer 1000 questions as to why I’m here. I did an automated system (won’t give specific because I don’t want to accidentally cause a security risk) I was expecting the worst but legitimately sailed through.

P.S. I think they do accept Thai driving licenses, but they really should exclude certain countries. Lol, getting a driving license in countries like Thailand or the Philippines is really easy, and there's a lot of corruption there (people buy driving licenses).

An idea that came to my mind - I posted this post about it on [**r/NewIran**](https://np.reddit.com/r/NewIran/), what do you think? (Sorry for posting there first, although עניי עירך קודמים, but אין נביא בעירו either...)

I'm not sure this is the right place, but I don't know of a better one to upload this post... I recently had an idea to create a new sub on reddit, which would be a kind of secular and optimistic version of AskMiddleEast. It can be called ""New Middle East"", or something like that, and it will be intended for people who aspire to live in a peaceful, enlightened and educated Middle East that is connected to its ancient heritage, and not necessarily only to the Islamic one. Sub without poison and hatred, simply of connecting to the rich cultural heritage of the region and hope for a future of freedom and prosperity.

I am very proud of my identity as an Israeli Jew, but I think that a general Middle Eastern identity, which is not Arab or Islamic, should also be cultivated. Probably at first we will be pretty much just Israelis and Iranians, but we have to start somewhere....

I have no experience moderating a sub, so if any of you like the idea and want to create this sub you are more than welcome. what do you think?"

I really enjoy discussing the weekly parsha, but I’ve recently moved to a new area recently for grad school where there really aren’t many Jews.

At first they didn’t realize we were Jewish. We looked like our neighbors. But then someone reported us. So our home was registered as a Jewish residence. We knew our days were numbered. Time was a ticking bomb. Then late one night a non-Jewish friend of ours showed up at our house.

“Listen to me,” he told us with great urgency. “Dig a hole under your fence and crawl out two at a time. Someone will meet you at the other end and lead you to safety. Tomorrow all the Jews in town will be executed”. 

His name was Kazi Bitdayev. And he secretly took all 6 of us to the neighboring village of Zheguta. He hid us there for 8 months, each week coming back for us and relocating us to a new basement or attic. He protected us. He fed us. He was our angel. After the war we searched for him for decades, desperate to thank him for saving our lives. But it was no use. We couldn’t find him.

In 2021, we finally located Kazi’s grandchildren. And got to thank them. A moment I waited for my whole life. Hashem has truly blessed me.” Zinayida Segal (pictured holding a photo of her rescuer Kazi) passed away last August in Rostov. She is pictured with her daughter Menucha Simcha, and granddaughter Chaya.
May her memory be a blessing.

1,2023-08-08,The growing threat of Palestinian terrorists launching rockets from Judea & Samaria,u/yogilawyer,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/15l29li/the_growing_threat_of_palestinian_terrorists/,"**6 times in the last 3 months, Palestinian terrorist organizations have tried to launch rockets against Jewish communities bordering on northern Samaria.** 

Major Generals  Uzi Dayan and Gadi Shamni, and former head of Israel's Homa Missile Defense Organization, Uzi Rubin, strongly recommend that we ""kill it off at birth.""

&#x200B;

**This is exactly how it began in Gaza.** 

Palestinian terrorists developed weapons made of irrigation pipes, traffic signal poles, or other similar tubular objects for the rocket airframe, which were readily available. Iran, through Jordan, is equipping the terrorists in northern Samaria with the right technology to build rockets. They are learning how to build the rockets from Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, Jordan and social media. 

&#x200B;

**This is a serious threat.** 

Gaza went from homemade rockets to firing up to 4,500 in a span of a few days. Rockets from Samaria can threaten major Israeli cities such as Tel Aviv, which is within 40 miles. 

&#x200B;

**What can Israel do to prevent this potential threat?**

**1.Prevent the smuggling activity.** 

It is relatively easy to smuggle 107 mm Katyusha rockets, the main ones that have been in use here in recent years. 

**2. IDF needs more mobile checkpoints** rather than fixed ones that remain in the same location for weeks on end. 

Mobile checkpoints move from place to place once every few hours. This is most effective and works not only against the rocket threat but also against vehicles used by terrorists for shooting attacks. 

**3. Increased intelligence.** 

We just had Operation Home and Garden, and now we need to make 'Home and Garden visits' and to look for workshops and machine shops dealing with rocket production, not only in Area A but also in Areas B & C.

He has a client who identifies as modern orthodox. She is a member of a modern orthodox shul and her kids are in day school and orthodox camps. On Friday, the client called my brothers colleague who was sitting next to him and he took the call on speaker. The client said she was currently in Hong Kong & was leaving work soon for dinner, so could he please send her a certain report soon. My brother looked at the clock and realized it was 2 hours after candle lighting in Hong Kong at the time of the call. The client was still at work on shabbes, but in a place with few Jews and probably fewer, if any, who knew her. 

My brother doesn't want to interfere in the woman's private life. But he's torn about notifying people in her community, many of whom he's friends with, of the incident. Because they would be concerned about chezkas kashrus and stuff. 

If someone is publicly mechalel shabbes but no one around knows they are Jewish, what is their halakhic status? What would you do in the situation?"

I am writing a school paper on certain aspects of the Bar Mitzvah ceremony. I hope that this topic is not offensive or does not spark debate, but I deeply apologise if it does. Also, feel free to provide other outlooks on these points! :)

I am looking for anecdotal recounts or personal points on the following: 

1. How has modern consumerism affected the *personal* experience of the ceremony for the Bar Mitzvah and their family?
2. Does it ever feel as if there is stress associated with keeping up with the modern celebrations in terms of the ceremony?

Obviously, this narrative has some problems, but let's assume that it is in fact true. The second part of the narrative goes that the Palestinians are being prevented from being helped by the world's ignorance or more often some kind of malicious action (i.e. The Israel Lobby, Western racism, Holocaust guilt, etc).

Today I would like to present another possibility: there are in fact lots of people, especially in the West, who want to help the Palestinians beyond the fanatical pro-Palestinian activist class. The problem, though, is not that we are unwilling to help the Palestinians, it's that we don't know how. Because every time we try and help the Palestinians, they take our help and exploit it to immoral and unjust ends. Just a few examples of this:

Palestinians ask us for foreign aid, and we give them foreign aid, and they spend that foreign aid on weapons to kill Jews.

Palestinians ask us to help them educate their children, and we give them money for UNRWA schools, and those UNRWA schools use that money to teach kids it's a good thing to kill Jews.

Palestinians ask us to give them a platform, and so we do, and then they use that platform to spread hatred of Jews and explain why they are justified in killing Jews.

Palestinians ask us to boycott Israel, allegedly to stop Israel's ""human rights violations,"" but then it turns out the true goal of the boycott movement is to destroy Israel, which in the process will surely kill Jews.

Palestinians want us to repeat their narrative, so we do, and then they use that narrative as a reason why they are justified in killing Jews.

Palestinians want us to make Israel end the occupation, but the last time Israel did Palestinians used their new territory as a launching pad for rockets designed to kill Jews.

Palestinians want us to pressure Israel in reducing the IDF's presence in the West Bank, but every time Israel does, terrorists take advantage of it to kill Jews.

I think you get the picture at this point. Every time we try and help the Palestinians, the result is more attempts to kill Jews. So that's why people, especially in the West,aren't exactly tripping over themselves to help the Palestinians right now. How can we help the Palestinians without them taking advantage of it to kill Jews? What do you think?"
1,2023-08-08,Husband is gatekeeping our sons Jewish identity,u/Creepy_Bloob,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/15lipai/husband_is_gatekeeping_our_sons_jewish_identity/,"Hi everyone! 
I never thought I’d be having this conversation with my husband, let alone posting here. Anyway, here I am and looking for some advice. 

My husband was raised in a high holiday secular Jewish household. His mom is Jewish, dad is not. When we first met he identified as Jewish,and  over the years I have been a part of all the major Jewish holidays with him and his family. We have always planned on raising our children Jewish. For them to be aware and involved in their Jewish ancestry and identity. 

Fast forward and we now have a son, a dark blonde but blonde nonetheless baby. Once, the baby lost his dark newborn hair and it came in blonde, DH has been making comments about having a “blonde haired blue eyed son” how he “didn’t expect it” “he doesn’t look Jewish” “he’s basically not Jewish” “the old laws” he’s been gatekeeping our child’s Jewish identity. I honestly have had enough of it. His hair color doesn’t matter, there’s plenty of blonde Jews and it’s dark blonde it’ll be brown here in a couple of years tops. 

We go back and forth. I tell him the old laws were in place because you always knew who the mother is, that’s not how today is. I told him if he wants to raise his son Jewish then he’s going to have to stop because eventually baby will pick up on it. 

He agreed with me, said he’ll stop, but clearly this is an issue for him.

 Do y’all have any advice or tips how to help my husband with this transition? Honestly, I never thought in a million years I’d be having this conversation with hmim. I’m not sure if it stems from all the antisemitism fear or what, but I’m over it.


***Edit for more context. 

 We both live/grew up in the American South (which doesn’t help) and DH never attended temple. His mom is a NY Jew and his sense of “Jewishness” came from his mom and her family. But his mom/ family is very close by and very much involved with her grandson. 

I agree with some of y’all, I believe he’s having an identity crisis himself and isn’t sure how pass this along to his son. 

We are both not religious/ I am not Jewish. I am not opposed to conversion/ going to synagogue. I’ve mentioned before to DH if he wanted to get involved in the community he’s kinda nah about it. 

I am committed myself to our son knowing his culture. I have the baby book club and have been thinking about taking the little guy to the local J baby events. 

Thank you all for your thoughtful responses, I am going to talk this through a little more, and if he’s open to counseling on this, I am open as well."

Jamie Foxx has a lot of followers on Instagram and the post received a lot of likes, one of which was from Jennifer Aniston. He has since deleted the post.

Now, understandably many Jews and antisemitism activists got quite upset because of the connection to the age-old ""Jews killed Jesus"" antisemitic trope. Many people thought he was referring to Jews in general, or perhaps a specific friend who was Jewish. He quickly issued an apology and explained that it wasn't in reference to Jews at all.

In following the discussion on Twitter, it appears this is a common saying in the Baptist Church referring to people who are supposedly friends but stab you in the back, as Judas did to Jesus. Some still think he was being antisemitic, but most Jews seem to have accepted his apology and recognized the misunderstanding.

Unfortunately the story doesn't end there because this incident seems to have opened a rift between the Black and Jewish communities. If you search for posts about the incident on Twitter, you'll find a lot of pretty nasty comments from Black people directed at Jews who spoke up about his post. Things like telling us to ""stop crying"" and ""it isn't always about us"" and how Jamie Foxx doesn't owe us an apology or explanation. There are also a lot of comments along the lines of, ""We're not going to stop using certain phrases just because Jews think everything is antisemitic.""

I've participated in exchanges with people on Twitter about it and I've found a lot of it quite disturbing. Just wondering if others were aware of it, or what you think about the whole thing now that you are."

However I've been to Sinai through Eilat/Taba border crossing few years ago, the Egyptian side stamped on my passport that I've entered and exited from Taba border crossing, which means, I was in Israel and returned to Israel.

I presume that will be a problem too when entering Lebanon? If anyone had similar experience or more info, would love to hear! Thank you!!"

Apparently, the hasidic belief is that there is a person born each generation with the potential to become Messiah. This candidate is known as the Tzadik Ha-Dor, and if he 'qualifies' then he becomes the Tzadik Emet (Messiah).

This is all the information I could find about this belief, and I'd like to know more details. If any of you are familiar with it, I would appreciate some more information, link to primary sources, or, preferably, answers to my questions below:

Here are my questions:

1) Is the Tzadik Ha-Dor chosen at birth, or a young age, or is he selected from a pool of potential candidates later in development (like 18-25) because he shows the most outstanding potential?

2) How does the chosen candidate qualify to become the Messiah? Is he ""elected"" by the Jewish leaders at the time? 

3) Since there is a candidate every generation, could there, theoretically, be a 30 year old and 60 year old Tzadik Emet both alive and ruling as Messiah simultaneously?"

I’m conservative in my religious affiliation but politically moderately liberal. 

This new coalition is bothersome .. with the passing of the reasonableness law, the new efforts of judicial reform they’re trying to pass, law of return amendments they’ve considered doing. I had some questions for my Israeli brethren if I may, and please try to answer with your most unbiased prediction;


1.) Do you think this coalition will collapse and trigger a re-election? I saw an article posted recently regarding as to how there are four (& maybe more) Likud MKs who May vote ‘no’ on the coming judicial reform legislation, wouldn’t that trigger a collapse since Ben-Gvir & his followers will quit working for not getting what they want? 

2.) Do you think the Judicial reforms will go through?

3.) If an election is triggered, do you foresee Bibi winning again?

4.) Do you think that the Law of Return regarding the potential removal of the grandchild clause and the potential removal of recognition for converts of no previous Jewish background in Reform or Conservative Judaism will go through?


I think if any of the above continues it’ll completely destroy relations between Israel & the diaspora, or at least severe ties in many ways, financially. 


I don’t personally think the coalition is going to last much longer. My dad is a Jew & I love Judaism, I don’t want to see Israel ruin itself from internal issues …."

Diaspora patrilineal Jew here who did a gerim. 24, university educated, was planning to make aliyah and volunteer for IDF service .. I’m conservative in my religious affiliation but politically moderately liberal. 

This new coalition is bothersome .. with the passing of the reasonableness law, the new efforts of judicial reform they’re trying to pass, law of return amendments they’ve considered doing. I had some questions for my Israeli brethren if I may, and please try to answer with your most unbiased prediction;


1.) Do you think this coalition will collapse and trigger a re-election? I saw an article posted recently regarding as to how there are four (& maybe more) Likud MKs who May vote ‘no’ on the coming judicial reform legislation, wouldn’t that trigger a collapse since Ben-Gvir & his followers will quit working for not getting what they want? 

2.) Do you think the Judicial reforms will go through?

3.) If an election is triggered, do you foresee Bibi winning again?

4.) Do you think that the Law of Return regarding the potential removal of the grandchild clause and the potential removal of recognition for converts of no previous Jewish background in Reform or Conservative Judaism will go through?

5.) Do you, diaspora Jews, foresee your relationship with Israel changing if any of the aforementioned go through? If so, how?


I think if any of the above continues it’ll completely destroy relations between Israel & the diaspora, or at least severe ties in many ways, financially. 


I don’t personally think the coalition is going to last much longer. My dad is a Jew & I love Judaism, I don’t want to see Israel ruin itself from internal issues …."

Got to see all different parts of Israeli society and learn about it. I feel like I have a better understanding of the Palatinate/Israel conflict (by far not an expert at all) and learn about all different communities in Israel. Yes Israel isn’t a prefect country but neither is the USA. I felt like I could be myself and connect with Hashem so much more then in the  states. I was able to express my gender and Jewish identity freely (for me those are combined) and feel safe. I’m planning on taking a gap year in Israel next year because I love it so much. Yes this is my whole personality for the year but words can’t explain how much I love Israel, the friends I made, the places I saw and all of the cats I saw as well.

\-""other demographics are primitive, dangerously irrational and incapable of properly governing themselves?"" Check.

As much of an uncomfortable statement as it may be, if I wanted to convert an average person into an antisemite, I wouldn't show them knuckle dragging old school conspiracy propaganda, I would show them unedited posts by Zionists from this very subreddit.

There happens to be some Jewish cemeteries in the area and they look so beautiful and interesting.

I’d love to walk through one, but from the outside looking in, it’s pretty clear that Jews have a different idea on burial so I’m sheepishly asking a few questions out of a real due concern to not disrespect your culture.

1) Is the idea of just walking through a Jewish cemetery quietly and respectfully just to explore disrespectful?

2) Why are the headstones packed so close together? 

3) Is there anything you think I should know or do in order to respect these sacred spaces?"

My son is due to become a bar mitzvah in 2 years. My ex wants my son to read the Torah at a synagogue that he never goes to (either of them.) My son attends services at a different synagogue. The reason being, the synagogue that my son ACTUALLY attends is a Reform one, but his father’s family is Modern Orthodox and he feels that if he were to have the bar mitzvah at that synagogue, none of his extended family would attend. So he wants our son to do this at a different local synagogue, one that is much more Orthodox, but he himself refuses to go to services there, much less bring our son with him. My ex FIL attends this shul and could easily make a phone call and have it set up, but he won’t do so because he feels it’s not right to ask them to allow my son to make Aliyah in a shul where they don’t know him from Adam. There are only so many Sundays in any given year, and they are much coveted for bar/bat mitzvahs and it’s not fair to the people who DO attend. I myself am Reform, so I am ok with my son reading at the Reform synagogue (I have our 2 daughters here, and they will be attending services at the Reform synagogue here starting with the New Year.) I do understand my ex’s concerns about his family. But I don’t understand why he is unwilling to go to the other synagogue’s services for a while so as to establish his presence, make connections, and set a good example for our son. What are your thoughts?"

I was given his number, and I reached out, and we met up to see if I would be able to help. 

I started the conversation off by asking how his being Jewish is causing fundamental issues in the support group. He answered by telling me his name is really ""__"" (insert common Hebrew name) and not ""__"" and he uses this name because everyone gets his real name wrong. He tells me he was born in Israel, his mother is from Israel and.... about 45 minutes worth of telling me things that just don't add up. Mind you, he still hasn't answered the first question. He shows me some photos on his phone of him at the Kotel, 770, etc. and I notice his last name on one of them. Noted. 

At the end of the conversation I was fully convinced that he believes everything he told me. In my business I work in deception, not self deception. I can't help anyone grow if they're lying to themselves. I also do P.I. work on the side with a friend, catching cheaters mostly. So, I did what any concerned Jew would do and used my resources to try and figure out if this guy is legit and if he's dangerous. 

I built a nice family tree, got his birth records, his parents' records, reached out to Rabbi he kept name dropping, called the schools in Israel he claimed to study at, and now I just feel bad for the guy. He's whipped up a pretty wild story here. And hey, if he's attracted to Judaism and wants to take the steps to join up, by all means, that option is there. But I have to reiterate, I fully believe that he believes this all to be true, when it just isn't. And I'm not sure how to handle it now. I want to help him in an appropriate way, but if he can't be honest with himself, or if he's unable to acknowledge facts, I should say, what can I do?

These are dangerous times for the Jewish people. I have to question the motives of someone willing to go to these lengths in order to create a persona and have to lie about it, and for how long has he been lying? And to how many people? I just don't know right now. 

My main concern is for the safety of the group. If he's not hurting anyone and wants to continue his life this way, who am I to stop him? If he asks me for help, though, I have a sense of obligation to do what I can. I just haven't been on high alert about someone like this in a long time, I guess that's all."

For context, I have borderline personality disorder which makes my goals and self image changeable. I grew up in an abusive home where I had to sleep outside etc, and this conversion was something I saw as a way to gain a blueprint for living and avoid many of the abusive types that I encountered earlier in life. It led to me improving myself in many ways, but my observance waned in my 20s (I felt judged for being a convert by many Orthodox Jews, took issue with what I came to see as sexism in many orthodox synagogues, etc and gradually became less observant). I consider myself Jewish and still want to observe but don’t think orthodoxy is realistic for me anymore."

3: ""then, the Lord, your God, will bring back your exiles, and He will have mercy upon you. He will once again gather you from all the nations, where the Lord, your God, had dispersed you.

4: Even if your exiles are at the end of the heavens, the Lord, your God, will gather you from there, and He will take you from there.

5: And the Lord, your God, will bring you to the land which your forefathers possessed, and you \[too\] will take possession of it, and He will do good to you, and He will make you more numerous than your forefathers."" Deuteronomy 30:3-5 / 'ספר דברים, פרק ל', פסוקים ג'–ה

Explanation:  
This talks about an exile that will happened while it's written  
today we understand that this aleardy happened  
between 70 (the destruction the second temple)  
to 1948 (reestablishment of Israel)  
now read the Verses again and the Verses will speak themselves

Heres why:

1.too late or too early..busses never arrive in time..never . They are mostly late between 5-15 minutes. Sometimes its seems they never arrive so i need to whait 30+ extra.

Even worst,they some times arrive to early. Like 10 minutes early.so what happens is i need to be there 15 minutes before its arrives and then between 20 - an hour! And its so much worst because 

2: the heat! In the summer is so hot! .there isnt enough cover in buss stations to shield you from the heat(mainly in more major station). But the worst thing is most of those shelters dont even halp. They are build so poorly the sun still hits you or just makes the pod an oven(and lets not talk what happens if you are a solider. The man who designed the A uniform should be in the bottom of hell!!!!).and no you cant just sit behind the station or beside it because

3. Buss drivers dont stop/skip stations .
Many times i seen busses never arrive. 
And many more times i seen buss drivers just refuse to stop (not most off course but a big numebr still).i seen many times busses just not stopping..or even driving faster whan reaching a station.  Even if there is people right beside it(again its rare but not rare enough)..

I can keep going on .on how lines or horribly designed (way to long or dont stop in important stationa) .or how the stinks so badly and are soo dirty,on how there electricity breaks down all the time(its even a joke whit some people i know that the usb cords on the buss are just for show because they never work). But i will be here all day

So long story short fuck busses

> Over the course of three weeks, a German man who stoked antisemitism while claiming to be Jewish was unmasked and faced a public downfall.

> Frank Borner, a school teacher, had hosted two gatherings called “Meet a Jew” on the island of Fehmarn, on the northern coast of Germany. 

> On Tuesday, the news website Fehmarn 24 reported that the organization that was hosting these talks pulled the plug on future events with Borner. When asked by Fehmarn 24 if he is a Jew, Borner refused to answer.

> German Jewish author Henryk M. Broder and his colleague Moritz Gerlach first broke the story about Borner’s manufactured Jewish identity in the daily broadsheet Die Welt on July 19. The Welt journalists wrote that Borner claimed that Jews have a  “capacity for suffering.” Borner linked the alleged Jewish suffering to a “victim role” that adheres to Jews “archetypically, like primordial slime.”

> Borner also claimed in his talk that New York and Hollywood are “full of Jews” and “firmly in Jewish hands.”

It seems that in this brave new world where most civilized societies are anti-racist and anti-bigotry, the best way to spread anti-Semitism is to pretend to be a Jew and engage in ""introspection"" and ""self-criticism."" 

Borner's rhetoric about how New York and Hollywood are ""in Jewish hands"" is strikingly similar to ""anti-Zionist rhetoric"" about how Washington is controlled by Zionists. This is not a coincidence. 

This is now the third recorded instance of this kind of individual, and three times makes a pattern."

I’m Oleh Hadash, so I have no idea how the system actually works here, not on paper.

I left my motorcycle in a shop to be repaired after an accident.
It needed a bunch of parts, so the process was quite slow and the bike sat at the shop.
I didn’t get any calls from the owner about the fact that it’s inconvenient for them, during our last conversation I asked to order some parts and never got a callback, so assumed it was no hurry for them either.
Yesterday morning the owner of the shop called me out of the blue on the phone and started screaming. 
He said my motorcycle is too long in their shop and takes up space and I should come and get it. 
He was swearing at me. 
This morning of August 8 I came to the shop to get my motorcycle. 
The owner said I owe him 1200 shekels for 3 hours of work (they took some broken parts off the bike).
I said that it's too much for the work they did and the condition the motorcycle is in now. 
At this point the owner got close to my face with fists and started screaming at me. 
He said ""I will break your nose"" and other similar things. 
The other guy in the shop calmed him down. 
I agreed to pay because I was scared for my safety. 
When I was paying, I asked why he was screaming at me. 
He started to scream again ""You want to continue this?"". 
And then he hit me in the face. 
He wanted to hit me many more times, but the other person in the shop held him back. 
I did not scream at him, I did not hit him back. 
I am sure if the other person was not there, the owner would beat me badly.

I don’t know why I didn’t call the police then and there, even though the thought was in my head.
At work I filled an online report of the assault and I have an in person appointment with the police tomorrow.
My question is how realistic is the expectation that this situation gets handled in any way?
I’ve heard different thing about Israeli police, my friend was robbed by a neighbour and they didn’t even open the case.
I hope the shop had cameras, but they probably will delete the footage and the only witness also works there.
What can I do?"

From what I was able to gather, there were two initial 2-day warning strikes followed by an indefinite strike lasting approximately 2 weeks. Is this correct?

There was significant variance in reports on anything to do with salary. Reports about salary demands by doctors range from 50% to 100%. Reports on the government's initial offer range from 1% per year to a one-off increase of 20%. Reports on the agreed increase range from 12.3% to 49%. This is quite confusing.

As I understand it, the strikes were also about the number of hospital doctors, the time they had to see patients, and more.

Backstory:  Jimmy Dore is an American comedian who has a very progressive (aka liberal left) YouTube channel that comments on the news events of the day and interviews guests.  Robert Kennedy is the nephew of the beloved President  John F. Kennedy  (JFK) who was assassinated.  No one claimed responsibility, but for me personally, the fact that JFK was killed weeks short of his meeting with Israel to stop their nuclear weapons acquisition, always made me suspicious.   His brother Robert detested social injustice. Robert's son Robert is now running for president.  

During Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s recent appearance on The Jimmy Dore Show, the topic of Israel came up, and the Democratic presidential candidate expressed a range of perspectives and opinions that could have come straight out of the most pro-Likud Israeli apologist. Now The Grayzone's Max Blumenthal has come on to set the record straight and explain the misrepresentations, half-truths, propaganda and outright lies RFK shared.

I am pretty sure this will dash Kennedys bid for the White House.

1,2023-08-09,My Zionism,u/Mugwump611,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/15mlid6/my_zionism/,"I have been a proud Zionist since my teenagerhood.  I was a member of Masada, the youth arm of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), and served on its national leadership for several years, as well as running their monthly magazine (Ayin L'Tzion).  I spent the summer of 1973 in Israel on the ZOA's Leadership Training Course (LTC), and spent much of the fall working in NYC during the Yom Kippur war and its aftermath.

Even back in those days, when the ZOA was far less right wing than they are today, if you'd asked a ZOA leader what their thoughts were on the issue of the Palestinians, their answer would be ""there are no Palestinians"" (or some variation thereof).

Back in those days, some 50 years ago, I disagreed strongly with that position, as I do today.  Clearly, there were Arabs living within the boundaries of Medinat Yisrael who did not want to be Israeli citizens, whose families either had lived in those areas for generations or who had  left (or been compelled to leave) and were now living in ""camps"".  These people had every right, I believed then and I believe now, to govern themselves and have their own country.

What troubles me is that every time that an Israel leader has proposed a peace plan, it has been shot down by the Palestinian ""leadership"": first Arafat and his PLO, now Hamas, Hezballah, and, to perhaps a less relevent degree, the Palestinian Authority.  But does that change the Palestinian's rights to self-government? I don't think so.

Do I still consider myself a Zionist today? Absolutely.  This is what I believe Zionism means:

1. Zionism is the right of every Jew,  of all religious persuasions (including non-observant) to come to Israel and live and be citizens. Zionism does not favor any one group, sect, community or cult above anyone else.  My Zionism does not give any religious authority the right to determine who can marry and who cannot, who can perform marriages, who can avoid service in the military,  or who can worship at the Kotel.
2.  Zionism is the absolute right of every Jew to live in Israel... but not to live anywhere and everywhere one wishes.  The Torah does not, cannot, give Jews a deed to each and every square inch of Eretz Yisrael on both sides of the Jordan River.
3. Zionism does not deny the rights of non-Jews to live in the land, and in fact requires defending that right.  My Zionism does not displace people so that Jews (any Jews) can live in their places.  My Zionism remembers that the Germans did that to us in the run-up to WWII.
4. Zionism does not favor any group of Jews above any other.

So, in light of the way Israel has developed over the last 3-4 decades and especially how things have developed since this latest government took power, am I still a Zionist?

To paraphrase Winston Churchill, my Zionism calls me to fight Netanyahu and his supporters as if there was no anti-semitism and no anti-Zionism in the world, and to fight anti-semitism and the abhorrent anti-Israel and anti- Zionist groups (both here in the U.S. and elsewhere) as if the problems with the Israel government did not exist.

1,2023-08-09,How to date other jews?,u/throwrereaway,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/15mq8xr/how_to_date_other_jews/,"Basically the title.
 
Some backround: my mother is a finnish christian with askenazi roots and my dad is an israeli mizrahi jew. I grew up in Finland in a christian community, never went to a synagogue, never knew any jews from Finland. My dad and his side of the family lives in Israel, but I don’t like culture in Israel or visiting Israel, but I am a zionist. 

I have the Jaeken syndrome gene, which means if I’ll have children with a man who also has it, we would have a 25% chance of having a baby with the illness. I bring this up because this gene is common in ashkenazi jews.

I also have paranoid schizophrenia, not sure why, but this will probably mean something to a potential date.

I still live in Finland to this day, and still haven’t met any jews here. I live too far away from the two synagogues in Finland so I can’t even join the giyur.

The reason why I would date other jews is that I feel safe around jews. I have been in places and relationships with national socialists and muslims who have not made me feel safe. I wouldn’t have to explain myself to another jew and I wouldn’t be fetishised, and I wouldn’t get death threats on my genetic basis. Jews are my type, mentally and physically.

So how do I date jews? Where do I need to go? Can I do it online? Am I too scary to date? Do I count as a jew? Or am I just racist?"

I am only an ethnically Jew so I pass off as a normal German looks and behaviour wise . 

Recently I’ve gone through two years of high school and my classmates who are both Arab have been bullying me, not even jokingly, not even allowing me to say the word Israel, calling me a child killer, land stealer, I got PHYSICALLY hit once by another girl in class for no reason and they kept telling me free Palestine a million times. No matter the amount of bullying I never said anything bad back, I am not a political person, I am simply from Israel, I know many anti zionists say free Palestine as a statement of ignoring / boycotting Israel, fine, do you, I didn’t ask to be born here, but you can’t deny that currently it is very much a  developed and recognised state, so when a person asks me where I’m from, naturally I think about Israel I just think about my family I don’t start thinking about the government or the military, so why am I getting bad reactions when I just tell people where I’m from? I can’t tell them I’m from Palestine because I’m not Palestinian, I don’t share a Palestinian passport, I share an Israeli passport, I speak Hebrew, I went to an Israeli school, what do you expect me to say? It felt like they want me to die from shame and i tried multiple time to legit have a discussion with them but they are not even Palestinians they only listen to Al Jazeera and decide that’s it Jews are disgusting and are all enemies and it made my mental health skyrocket down because I am getting shamed in something I didn’t choose, it’s straight up racism by definition

1,2023-08-09,Frozen funds for Palestinian citizens of Israel,u/Distinct-Maybe719,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/15mt5ct/frozen_funds_for_palestinian_citizens_of_israel/,"It’s been a few days, and I’ve seen no discussion in this sub of Smotrich’s freeze on US aid on Palestinian municipalities in Israel and higher education for Palestinian-Israeli citizens

Smotrich refused an appeal from Israel’s national security advisor to release funds, citing that education breeds terrorism among Palestinians, and that funding Palestinian higher education is too risky for security (around 35M). Another 85.5M was approved in 2022 after the Israeli government itself recognized years of insufficient resource allocation to to Arab localities. The blockade of these funds could mean that the 67 Arab councils can’t provide services like trash pickup and public education to their residents. In this appeal, Minister Hangebi stated that an increase in education has actually led to decreased terrorism in Jerusalem. 

So basically: for citizens of Israel who happen to be Arab, 53M is being withheld for education, and 85.5M to provide services in Palestinian municipalities. 

Netanyahu says he opposes this, but has yet to override this decision, I suppose until “proper security mechanisms” are in place… As equal citizens of Israel, why should one group have their funds (US supplied aid) withheld, and fall under specific scrutiny? this isn’t equality for all citizens.  If it were about a commitment to peace and curbing violence, then the same type of measures should also be imposed on settlers who are committing violence in the WB. They are also Israeli citizens.  I understand that the West Bank and Jerusalem are two separate cases, but if we’re talking about Israeli citizens inciting violence, it seems targeted to only implicate the Arabs. I can already hear the calls of whataboutism here… but sometimes observations made through competing questions are worth thinking about. 

This isn’t a call to attack Palestinians and say they deserve it, or to dig up history— there is certainly a history here, but the current government is moving mad a bit… That’s what I’m focused on— the context in which this is happening (as funds have been withheld before). moreso I am interested in takes on the state of Israel’s regime and their current in-fighting. Israeli academics and politicians are not United in this decision— it seems to be unpopular… *and* it is decisions like these that allow for a case that Israel is becoming an apartheid state. 

This isn’t a post meant to be a gotcha or an incitement (esp since this seems to be an unpopular decision in Israel)— but that’s exactly my point: when things go too far when it comes to discriminatory actions, how much support can you give? Do you support this decision? When the Hebrew university is condemning this, Lapid is out here tweeting that this is racist, etc., it’s hard for me not wonder about the views of those who aren’t intertwined with Israeli institutions.  

These funds were meant to close the gap between Arab and Jewish communities in Israel, benefitting all Israeli citizens. 

As always, you are more than welcome to skip past this post if you feel that it is not a contribution to the sub that is worth your time!

I am new to this subreddit so if this discussion has already been had, I apologize.   
There is a youtube video looking into this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVWp1\_JMmak

Here are some of the points.

&#x200B;

1. Mainly European 

Theodore Herzl, the founder of the Zionist Congress said in the beginning of his book “The Jewish State”:   
“The common people have not, and indeed cannot have, any historic comprehension. They do not know that the sins of the Middle Ages are now being visited on the nations of Europe.” (THE JEWISH STATE AN ATTEMPT AT A MODERN SOLUTION OF THE JEWISH QUESTION, pg. 16) 

It seems to be of consistent knowledge that the Jews endured their worst times in Europe since their first exile. In the wake of the Davidic Monarchy's demise, the Jewish people have endured centuries of adversity, punctuated by fleeting moments of liberation and benevolence. How does one gauge the threshold of resilience in the face of relentless mistreatment? From an outsider's perspective, as a non-Jew a goyim, it is observed that they were once regarded as the chosen ones, yet war relinquished of this favor and have since borne the weight of retribution. And now, weary of this plight, they yearn to seize control of their destiny, all the while acknowledging that God orchestrates our fate. They recognize the futility of challenging a higher power, yet their resolve persists, even if it entails sacrificing themselves and potentially affecting others. Such is the essence of the Zionist ideal.   


2. It does not support Jewish Religious Law

Before Modern Day Zionism, Jews that moved to the holy land mostly were willing to live under the rule of the Muslims, not build their own Nation since, they must wait for the Messiah to even establish a State. 

“An activism broke out among the Messianic movements that pushed for ‘the End’ and tried to speed up the process of deliverance. This contradicted the classical attitude of rabbinical Judaism, the faith in patiently waiting for the Messiah, until God sends Him to the people. ‘He will come suddenly, without warning, and just when He is least expected or when hope has long been lost’. The leading belief in the Messiah by rabbinical Judaism held tightly to the interpretation of exile as being a punishment from God.” (pg. 26, The First Zionist Congress in 1897 Causes Significance Topicality by S. Karger AG, 1997) 

However, other Jewish scholars of the modern age, propose a different perspective. They see the ingathering of exiles and the return to the Land of Israel as a period rather than a specific person. This act, believed to be guided by the hand of God, could ultimately lead to the coming of the Messiah in the events surrounding the establishment of the State of Israel. These scholars are coping. (Look at Jeremiah 23:5-6, Isaiah 11:1-5, Isaiah 11:11-12, and Jeremiah 23:8, Hosea 3: 4-5, Isaiah 2: 3-4, Micah 4:2-3, Jeremiah 33:16-18, others before)

3. The spiritual creator of Modern Day Zionism helped create Marxism as well: Moses Hess

“Since Spinoza Jewry has brought forth no greater spirit than this forgotten, faded Moses Hess!"" (The Complete Diaries of Theodore Herzl, Vol. 3, pg. 1090, 1960) 

The first Proto-zionist was Moses Hess, a harbinger challenging religious scripture, emerged as the foremost advocate for a Jewish State. In his groundbreaking work ""Rome and Jerusalem: The Last Nationality Problem"" published in 1862, he created the first Zionist literature before the coinage of the term ""Zionism."" Herzl was not aware of his work but when he later read them, deemed Moses Hess as the pioneer for the movement. Probably the biggest reason he was not as known as was due to him being collegues with Karl Marx and helping him and Engels write the famous Communist Manifesto. Hess was a marxist who mixed socialist ideas with Messianic ideas. He saw socialist ideals in Judaism already. 

He as well as Herzl saw Zionism as an extension of European Ideals manhandling the Middle East  
“In other words, some external configuration was needed so that the Jewish race could reorganize itself as a nation, so that the redemption of the world could begin. Just as his socialist ally in Germany, Ferdinand Lassalle, found that moment in 1863 with the possibility of a new, strong, imperial Prussia under the leadership of Otto von Bismarck, Hess found that moment in the strong leadership of the French nation by Napoleon III, an “iron dictatorship of kingship” … Imperialism and racially oriented nationalism, then, would be the motors of a progressive history; against Marx, Hess asserted that “the race struggle is the primary one, and the class struggle secondary. And yet, despite his turn to nationalism and his sympathies with Napoleon III’s imperialism, Hess remained a committed socialist.”” (Love, Death, and Revolution in Central Europe, Chapter 2, pg. 65-66)   
“For Jewish colonization to India and China, there is no lack, either of Jewish laborers or of Jewish talent and capital. Let only the germ be planted under the protection of the European powers, and the tree of a new life will spring forth by itself and bear excellent fruit.” (Rome and Jerusalem, Fifth Letter, p. 169)

Then a follow up there's a book called the book of Mary Magdalene where some weird knowledge is dispensed saying basically there's no such thing as sin...

1,2023-08-10,The Complexity of Identity: Exploring the Status of Jewish Converts to other Faiths,u/dudbbdudhddb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/15mw8rr/the_complexity_of_identity_exploring_the_status/,"Hey fellow Redditors of r/Judaism,

I've been grappling with a question that I hope we can discuss and shed some light on together. It's about the treatment of Jews who have converted to another religion. We often emphasize that being Jewish encompasses both a religious and an ethnic dimension. For instance, we acknowledge that atheists can retain their connection to Judaism despite their lack of religious observance. However, when it comes to Jewish converts, it seems there's a shift in perception – they are sometimes treated as though they've lost their Jewish identity altogether. This raises several thought-provoking questions.

Why does a Jewish convert appear to lose both their ethnic and religious Jewish identity? Could we be overlooking the possibility that, like atheist Jews, many converted individuals remain proud of their Jewish heritage despite their change in faith? Is it justifiable to deny them the ""right of return"" to Israel based solely on their religious choice?

While some might argue that Jewish converts have willingly distanced themselves from the Jewish people, does this assertion truly reflect the reality? Many instances can be found where Jewish converts to other religions still maintain their connection to their Jewish roots. This leads us to a complex conundrum – why is a Jewish convert's commitment to their heritage often overlooked?

Let's consider a parallel scenario: Would it be reasonable to declare that a Serbian individual who abandons the Orthodox faith is no longer Serbian? Such a notion would likely raise eyebrows, yet we find a similar concept applied to Jewish converts.

I'm eager to hear your insights and engage in a respectful and open-minded discussion. Our community's viewpoints can help unravel the multifaceted nature of this topic, shedding light on the underlying reasons and potentially reevaluating our perceptions.

Looking forward to your thoughts and opinions."

1,2023-08-10,Was I fired for being a Jew?,u/Dapper-Software2896,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/15mxjt9/was_i_fired_for_being_a_jew/,"I, 17M, was recently fired from a Chick Fil A in California. I liked my job and had numerous friends there (and I really liked the food so the free meals were amazing). I was a quiet worker, not very social, but I believe that’s what the managers wanted because whenever I did speak with others or I heard louder convos between co-workers, they were usually shut down by a manager. 

I typically don’t listen to the online drama surrounding Chick. I know they were in trouble for sending funds to anti-LGBTQ organizations, but I also know they’ve made steps to reverse that history. In reality, when you work these low level jobs, your working for the owner, not the CEO of Chick. 

However, I’m severely confused as to why I was fired. There’s a point system (points are bad) and you need 12 to be fired. I had only 2 and when I followed up on a call after I  had returned home from my shift, I was told that had nothing to do with it. Furthermore, I was fired ON THE SPOT. No briefing, no two weeks, etc. In the middle of my shift, I was told to clock out. When I was told I was being fired I was too shocked to ask any questions. They told me they reviewed my “two week extension” and found that I wasn’t a good fit for the restaurant. But I wasn’t told I had a a two week extension at all, in fact, I wasn’t on a two week suspension! (This extension is what they give you when you get 12 points. They make you sign a document saying if you don’t fix your behavior you will be let go. I signed no such document) When I called a different manager after I had returned home, she told me I just wasn’t a good fit and they review people on how they interact with coworkers and customers etc. I kept trying to get a single distinct reason and I couldn’t. I know about others who have been fired for a variety of reasons and NONE OF THEM were fired on the spot.

I’m the only Jew I know of working at this restaurant. From what Ive heard the owner is a crazy christian. Like fundamentalist type. She was there the day I was fired. That day was special, because I wore my chain with a star david on it. i typically don’t wear it but today i randomly put it on. the clothes i were wearing also easily let the chain slip out. I think that maybe my chain slipped out and the owner saw because she was the one who came up to me and told me with the widest smile ever that “they need you in the office, i don’t know what for”

I wrote this very quickly so sorry if it sounds dumb. I know I’m probably just ruminating but I seriously don’t know what i did to get fired.

EDIT: I am not going to sue anyone. I am just epically confused about the ambiguity of my employer’s reasons and the abruptness and arbitrariness of my fire. I don’t want to start speculate that I was a bad employee when I’m sure I wasn’t.
-P.S. Both my parents are lawyers, while only my mom works. They’re both still “practicing” though. They went to very prestigious schools and both have 30+ years of experience even though they mostly do contract law. I’ve spoken to them about it but their priorities seem all over the place. My mom tried to tell me this would make a good college essay, but i don’t want to spend my senior year in litigation against a fast food restaurant just so I have a better chance at college. I like your ideas about filing for unemployment and I will speak to my parents about it. 
-P.S. My parents say that if I were to take up litigation against cfa, this would be against the franchisee and not have much to do with the billion dollar corporation."

I just spent a month in Israel and absolutely fell in love. Absolutely. There's lots of good, and obviously some bad... But much prefered over my situation in Canada.

I was originally born in Israel and moved away at a young age 

It got me thinking of an eventual future there. 

I'm currently studying in a bachelor's of accounting at a top uni, will graduate this year and pursue a CPA license in Canada with an option of transfering to the US. Locked in with a job at a big 4 accounting firm.

I'm asking myself how this can eventually be utilized into a future career in Israel. 

Any insight is super appreciated!!"

I got through the hatifat dam brit conversation, probably the scariest part for cis men, by finally coming out to my rabbi as trans. 

That means, from a gender perspective, the last hurdle is mikvah immersion, specifically witnesses. I don't really feel comfortable with *anyone* seeing me naked except my partner. I have been stealth for years, even coming out to my rabbi was a huge, and I hate the idea of coming out to two more people. Then, on one hand I wouldn't want women as my witnesses because I'm not a woman, and so don't want to spend the rest of my life knowing I did this the way a woman would. On the other hand, I care more about passing to other men and the dysphoria of not only coming out to men but the chance of them seeing my pre-surgery body (T for 6 years now, but no money for surgery) is pretty huge.

My rabbi says, and I've read elsewhere that, the witnesses can't really see anything nudity-wise. But it's still upsetting to think about. Is anyone willing to share what they did and how it went for them?"

I've been hard pressed to find health insurance which will cover my pre-existing conditions (I have three of them, and take four prescription meds for which I will bring a year supply). The four major providers (Harel, Menora, Maccabi, Meuhedet) plans for non-citizens do not cover pre-existing conditions.

I've been thinking of just buying into one of these plans (which won't cover the pre-existing conditions) for the sake of getting my visa application going, then looking for additional insurance which I'm having difficulty finding. But any advice would be much appreciated!"

I am doing my best to understand Israel. I understand that the mandate originated during Biblical times as bestowed upon the Jewish people by God. Then, fast forward to our recent era and somehow, the League of Nations approved this idea which established the state.  

Among the many things I don't understand, the United Kingdom was somehow involved and land was carved out from other territories to create Israel. But I also don't understand is where the leadership had been prior to the formation of Israel? I only imagine that they were preparing themselves for the possibility of the nation state and moved to Israel once it was created.

The British owned ""The Mandate of Palestine"" which gave it special powers to create a Palestine or Jewish nation out of Palestinian territory. But this whole idea of one nation having the power to create new nations out of an old empire doesn't compute for me yet. Thank you for helping me understand."

Basically, my question is this, whenever I read about Jewish prayer, I might be reading old texts from the 1960s and 70s mostly because that’s where I’m getting this from, but also some of the newer stuff, because in Judaism, the old resources are generally respected more, when I see about prayer is that you’re really supposed to pray and ask for things that you need and almost like bag, the creator to give you those things that you need, I have read numerous times that it’s almost like you’re not worthy of the things that you’re praying for so that you really need to bag and even cry for the things that you need.

The other side of things, because, even though I am Jewish, I am also interested in main stream, spirituality, and new concepts new ideas, on this side of things, which I generally find more welcoming more interesting, more modern and more heartfelt, there’s a lot about manifesting what you want, so if you really want some thing, if you need to pray for something, whether it be better health or more money, or to cure depression, or to get out of a difficult living situation, or to find new acquaintances and meet new friends, or to find your life‘s passion and purpose, what they say on this side of things is to manifested by meditating on The idea or the vision that you already have these things. So if you really need better health just to envision yourself in a healthy state and that it will come that way.  

I find that this is contrary to what I’m reading in the older Jewish texts, in those sources, it says to pray, and even bag from a desperate place for what you need, but then these newer things that I’m reading, say to manifest it, with love, and to believe that you have it already. Now I don’t think the Jewish sources are against anything with manifestation, I’ve never read that you cannot manifest things, although I have read that you’re not supposed to go into a trance to foresee the future, but I’m really just hoping that someone can clarify if it is OK to try to manifest good things by meditating on them and bringing them through good energy and hopefulness instead of prayer based on lack"

I’m afraid to talk to anyone about this - including a rabbi - so I’ve turned to Reddit.

No one knows about this except my husband and my boyfriend. They are both extremely distraught. I am left with the options of abortion or giving the child up for adoption. I’m currently 9 weeks. 

I am already depressed and have been suicidal before and this has sent me straight back to that place. I honestly cannot fathom abortion and even adoption makes me feel terrible. I can’t imagine doing either to my own child when I know that theoretically I can care for the child financially. 

I know that I need to tell a rabbi but I’m afraid of what he might tell me. If anyone has any advice in this area I would appreciate it.

I'm in my 40s so I have kids and a wife who are non-Jewish, so I'm trying to find a practice that's nice for them, nice for me, and also honors G-d.  I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts or advice on how to make it nicer, more special, to include everyone else (even though they aren't Jewish), or really anything else.

My basic plan is:

1. Have family dinner together tonight, with candle lighting, and make it extra special for everyone. Fresh flowers, tasty treats. The meal won't generally be kosher since I'm the only Jew, but I'll try myself to hold to some basic rules. Include Kiddush wine. Challah is beyond me to make, and there's nowhere to buy it here, but maybe some day in the future. I'll say blessings to myself as I go.
2. Keep the candles lit until the end of shabbat on Saturday.
3. For me, no or very minimal technology (as required to not exclude myself from the family) but everyone else can do whatever they want. Play with my kids, talk with my wife, read some Torah, and just focus on the family and G-d instead of tv or phone myself.
4. Go to synagogue by myself on Saturday.

I know this is not very kosher at all, but I'm generally following the guidance from my Chabad rabbi that doing one little thing better than yesterday is good enough. And a top priority for me is not to create chaos in my home, just good feelings. So I'm balancing a lot here. :) But I'd love thoughts from other people with mixed families how they create something special and welcoming that involves everyone. Thanks!

To add some context, I'm not of Jewish faith and don't belong to any religion in general. However, I'm interested in many things and enjoy gaining knowledge. :-)

I was in the Jewish part of Prague with my girlfriend, and we visited the synagogues, monuments, and cemetery there. During our visit, I had a few questions:

1. I wore the kippah the entire time (as a sign of respect since I was a guest). Is that the right thing to do? Some people didn't wear it at all, while others only wore it indoors.

2. There was a grave there, somewhat in the middle of the circular route, that stood out from the others. It wasn't just a simple stone, but more like a small house (with a smaller roof in the center compared to the side walls, and front and back ""walls"" with two columns on each side). The unique thing was that it was the only grave where people were praying. (I didn't take a photo of the grave as I felt it would be disrespectful to photograph people while they were praying. Other visitors didn't seem to share this sentiment and took photos of the people there as if in a zoo.)

3. There was a man wearing a black coat, a hat, and sidelocks, praying at that same grave. He even moved the barrier aside and seemed very emotionally charged. He was also the most fervent/exuberant in his prayers. His wife, who had been recording videos of him the whole time, just continued without praying at the stone herself. Why didn't she pray at the grave? Would it have been okay for me to ask her a question or engage in conversation?

I hope these questions aren't disrespectful or inappropriate, and that it's okay to use this Reddit thread for them."

I live in the U.S.A and I may be a minor but I can still have my own opinion even if she doesn't support me. I like Judaism because I could pray to God himself. I feel like my mom is such a conservative Catholic in the sense she takes things so serious like that. 

Like when me and my brother were little kids we were watching a Gabriel Iglesias comedy movie on Netflix and he made a joke about going to church and having to call the priest father and she said turn that off it is against my religion. Not that anything was wrong with that since that's her opinion.

I just don't see why she is so mad at me.  To be honest she isn't a role model Catholic either her and my dad had us living with no power for a while until we moved to my grandma's and my grandmother got mad at me because it was so hot one night I came back over and she was mad despite ""loving God"" more than everything including her own dead husband ( my grandpa) 

I feel like my family are materialistic liers too. I was hoping my mom would support me so I could go to a synagogue but that's off the table until I'm an adult.

In a trail of flames, I'm on fire
I'm plugged in directly to Messiah
I run with the mighty Conners, we expose the liars
These infidels killed my mom, it's all-out war now
I swear on the Mahdi to never put my sword down
The crescent and the star with the red in the foreground is the flag that I bang as I'm layin' the law down
Stab us, the beach head behind enemy lines now
*I'm Pink Floyd in Berlin, I'm tearin' the wall down*
Face to face I bet Mary the devil would test me
And some fuck boy '85er would come run up and press me
It's all a hoax, quite simple, a joke like Zelensky
*The imams, the rabbis, and the pope incidentally*
Couldn't stop my boat, God from quoin' quotes from the senseis
*If anybody asks, tell 'em Farrakhan sent me
It's the war of armageddon and I'm beggin' the listener*
*If you ain't fightin' that mean you either dead or a prisoner*”

*ALL JEWS ARE EQUAL.*

 Even the Converts. This post dives into the use of the term “convert” specifically in the wider world, by those who are ignorant to Jewish life. This only mildly is talking about the Jewish world in an of itself, which is ultimately fairly accommodating for all Jews in spite of discrimination still existing. I’ll make a post later discussing more then issue of seeing converts as “less than” *which isn’t the goal of this post.*

 
I hate how in 2023, we all have access to the internet but people speak on Jewish Culture and History with blatant misunderstandings of what it all is. What is means to people all over the world.

Several genetic studies have explored the link between the Beta Israel community (also known as Ethiopian Jews) and other Jewish populations. One notable study that contributes to understanding this genetic connection is “The Genome-Wide Structure of the Jewish People” published in the journal Nature in 2010.

This study, led by researchers from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, analyzed genetic data from various Jewish and non-Jewish populations worldwide. It revealed that the Beta Israel community had genetic ties to both Middle Eastern and Ethiopian populations, providing evidence of their unique genetic heritage and their connection to Jewish communities.

In spite of this, to this day it seems like Black/Ethiopias Jews are lumped into the “convert” category, our real history being relegated to nothingness.

It’s hurtful on many levels, and while there’s much infighting amongst Jews (as a rule! Hah) it’s painful to be seen as “other” in a culture where we truly aren’t.

(In terms of Jewish)I have ancestry mainly Sephardic and Beta Israel, but my European/Euro American relatives are Ashkenazim(being mixed is fun!). I believe that our identity keeps us strong, no matter who we are. Imagine the burden of Jews all around the diaspora, maintaining their cultures to the best of their ability in spite of the hostile environment around them.

It’s not different now. Except Ethiopian Jews, without that recognized connection, are seen as secondary. Ethiopia’s Jews are some quite literally some of the most at risk people on Earth for death and suffering, between the current conflicts of the country, and the historical antisemitism that led many to force concert to Christianity and Islam.

By taking our blood tie away, you take away our ability to share our ancestral home with you simply as an equal. Project Moses and Solomon, two of the biggest campaigns to get Ethiopian Jews from Their country to Israel was done on the basis not that these were “committed converts” but simply because they were Jews.

Being predominately Black, my mixedness tends to be simplified and disappeared, but to see in 2023 the spread of misinformation, it hits different.

I hope for a more educated wider community about Jewish history, how devastating the Genocides and Forced displacements from Judea were, and and honest compensation for ALL Jews, so nobody has to live in fear for who they are. But even further, so they don’t have to doubt who they are."

1,2023-08-11,Why I support Israel after previously having extremist views against it,u/VeryHungryMan,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/15ojk15/why_i_support_israel_after_previously_having/,"Hi all, I’ve been wanting to share my story for a while on why I support Israel after hating its very existence for so many years. 

So I’m going to start off by saying I’m part Slavic and part Middle Eastern (most of that being Arab and Amazigh) among other things. I’d also like to point out I have Sephardic Jewish ancestors but I wasn’t raised Jewish and didn’t know this until recently. I’ve always supported Palestine in my younger years simply because a Palestinian married into my family but though my teen years I hated Israel and even used the Israeli flag as a doormat for my room. I would post online one of the many alleged human rights violations to try to prove my side and would not listen to any other opinion. 

However, the more I would learn about the conflict the less sympathy I would have for Palestine. Starting in 1936, some Palestinian Arabs fired the very first shot during the Arab Revolt and in the 40’s, Mufti Amin Al-Husseini befriended Adolf Hitler and even partially contributed to the idea of The Holocaust. Because of tensions, the UN split the land and made Jerusalem an International Zone. Israel accepted the plan and declared independence as the only Jewish state and the very next day, Palestinians along with the Arab League tried to destroy Israel and lost. They tried again and again to destroy Israel and they lost. 

Now a days, they label Israel as a Colonial and Apartheid state and cry bloody murder online. The simply fact is, Jews aren’t Khazars but rather they are native to that land and it’s been proven by genetic studies such as ones by the NIH, Harvard University, 23andme and Ancestry DNA yet Palestinians along with Bigots and many Muslims continue to dehumanize Jews with this myth. Another reason I stopped support them is because of the lies they tell such as forced evictions and killings. Silwan is a good example, Silwan was Jewish owned until 1948 and it’s believed to be where King Solomon’s garden was. In the 80’s or 90’s Palestinians built illegal houses on the land even though photos show no one living there and it was a National Park yet they lie and cry Apartheid on social media. Most evictions are in East Jerusalem and happen because a Jew buys the house or the tenants don’t pay rent. Another one is killings such as in the Jenin operation about a month ago. The Media along with Palestinians alleged Israel murdered innocent children yet failed to show the photos of them in terrorist uniforms with weapons but rather shows them in normal clothes smiling to gain sympathy. Other allegations are from well fillings too but fail to mention they are illegal under Palestinian and Israeli law and get filled because they are in areas such as Nablus that have water shortage and such wells are dangerous to wildlife. Gaza is another example of lying where they claim it’s a prison yet videos like [this](https://youtu.be/wCuOHr3jMMk) show Gaza is rather nice and sure Israel will destroy a building but what they don’t tell you is that Israel only does so to target a terrorist and they actually warn before a strike but it’s Hamas that tells them to stay. 

Arabs serve in the Israeli government and Palestinians can enter Israel but not the opposite. Israel sends food, water and materials to Gaza and the West Bank daily which no one mentions and sure you can tell me about Lehi and Irgun who weren’t even part of Israel and actual problems like settler violence but it’s clear Israel didn’t do anything wrong and most criticisms by not just Palestinians but “Human Rights Groups” and the UN are refuted lies with no basis. People will criticize anything Israel does but never talk about modern slavery in the gulf, abuse of Christians in MENA or anything else like that which clearly shows dishonesty and a double-standard.

Thanks for reading my story and I’d be more than happy to have a discussion."
1,2023-08-11,A possible solution one day,u/BigH200026,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/15ojr6c/a_possible_solution_one_day/,"I think at the moment there’s no solution but I also think a proper two state solution and a proper one state solution aren’t possible. I think some sort of confederation is the only option. 


I think an idea would be israel retains military control over gaza, wb, israel’s current borders. I think the wb and gaza could be kind of like states where they would handle their own internal security and all of that but anyone born in the wb or gaza whether arab or jewish would vote there for representatives and then those represenatatives will go to the Knesset. This means the palestinian side will have jews as well who will vote their since they would be born there.

Then israel will handle its own thing internally while having the military, later on in peace the arabs would add to the military as well, there will have to be agreements on immigration and ROR and I think it could be split somehow part jewish and part palestinians and then there would be freedoms of movement one day.

 That way israel can maintains its jewish culture and majority and the palestinians can have their part. I think jerusalem would be split with the arab part controlling east jerusalem but jews would have a rights to pray on the temple mount. 

As of now there’s no solution but I think this is a solution for one day if there is one I think it’s better than a two states solution or one state, two states really wouldn’t work I think because israel wants to control wb for many reasons. And one state won’t work."

Was talking to a friend about faith and he brought up the fact I am Jewish and used it as a way to bring the conversation to Israel. The whole time it felt like he was trying to talk over me and explain the history of Jewish people and zionism to me. As if I wasn’t Jewish. A big ick I got was when he said he “didn’t believe some Brooklyn schmuck should have the right to immigrate to Israel.” He also asked me if I planned on taking a birthright trip, and when I said that I did plan on it, he looked… I don’t know, a little perturbed. Also, he isn’t Jewish in any regard if you couldn’t tell. He has some developmental disabilities and is pretty passionate about geopolitics, so I tried to gently correct him and not take his words and talking over me too seriously but, yeah, definitely an uncomfortable conversation. Got some bad feelings and a sour taste in my mouth. At the end he said he didn’t want to offend me by anything he said and that he was a “far leftist,” and was against antisemitism. 

Whole interaction felt very off and I was going to flair this as antisemitism but again, I feel hesitant to call this antisemitism since I’m not sure if he understood the complexity of what he was talking about."

The first example I could think of was of Dr. Isaiah Friedlander, who has the Jewish stereotypical appearance and a pretty much Jewish name. If you played the game, you know the guy is clearly a crook. Also there’s Leopold Strauss. Strauss is not a exclusively Jewish last name, but it is still VERY common between Jews. Also, Herr Strauss’ appearance also resembles Jewish stereotypes: large noses and has big and deformed ears as antisemitic propaganda portrays Jews. It is also know that his hair was orange before getting grey (which is common in Jews. I don’t think that means anything per se, but when you put it all together it sounds like an additive). If you playerd rdr2, you know that Strauss is a cold-hearted explorer of the poor and desperate people that need money. Do you see a strange pattern here too, or am I exaggerating?"

The geopolitical landscape is changing. The cards are being reshuffled. Rogue nations like China, Russia, and Iran are ascendant. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Brazil are beginning to deal in Chinese yuans. The Third World is no longer the West's backyard. China is practicing neo-colonization in much of the Eastern Hemisphere with it's Belt and Road initiative and debt trap diplomacy. Based on their treatment of the Uyghurs, they're not particularly interested in protecting the rights of minority religions or ethnic groups.

Within the West, instability continues to grow. From the George Floyd rights, to the January 6th storming of the Capitol, to the Canadian trucker convoy blockade of Ottawa, to the recent riots across France, we are witnessing a steady escalation of unrest. If this continues, you will no longer be able to rely on the current cabal of Western elites to ensure your safety. Tremors of anti-Semitism can already be felt, like with Kanye West or more recently Jamie Foxx. It appears that, within the next couple decades, pogroms could become a very real possibility in some parts of the world.

It is an open secret that Jews have a disproportionate amount of influence in Western politics, media, finance etc... and in general, you tend to use this influence to promote progressive politics in Western countries. The fact of the matter is that we can't compete with China or maintain stability if we are arguing about things as silly as gender pronouns and the like.

Now on to the deal. I will be negotiating on behalf of all Western traditionalists.

Here are the terms: We will restore stability and deter China and other ""rogue"" nations. This may entail things that modern progressives would perceive as ""sexism,"" ""racism,"" ""homophobia"" etc... In return, you will stay out of Western politics and, in a larger sense, the Western media sphere forever. If you honor the terms, the Chosen Ones will remain blameless. However, if you break the terms, then everything goes up in flames and we burn together.. What do you say?"

The Jordanian ones are slightly bigger and more intimidating than the ones I saw in Israel/Palestine. I am not sure why though. They might be cross bred with other types of guard dogs, or that's just the way they are.

Online resources often associate this breed with Israel since the country took it as a national animal. I am wondering how successful Israel was in using them in more specialised tasks like military, police, search and rescue, drugs, personal protection.. etc. 

Especially when comparing them other breeds like Belgian Malinois or a German Shepherd."

While certain aspects may be subject to debate, the contents of this cylinder are irrefutable and present an unvarnished account of significant events. These events prompt a reevaluation of entire societies and the circumstances surrounding them.

It is evident beyond doubt that Cyrus aimed to rescue and protect the people of Sumer, Akkad, and Babylon. Specifically, the Babylonians were liberated from their burdensome lives under the rule of Nabonidus. Furthermore, there is no connection whatsoever between Cyrus and the Jewish or Judean people. In fact, additional cuneiform evidence indicates that a majority of Judeans chose to remain in Akkad.

If there exists a notion of ""Chosen People,"" it indisputably applies to the Babylonians, rather than the Jews. The Shah of Iran, during the 1970s, must have been aware of the discrepancy he propagated. Unquestionably, this revelation does not cast him in a favorable light.

Beyond all of that, with the idea an eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth, what would be the karma or consequence form not observing Shabbat? Thanks in advance for your insights. :)"

>32 Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. 33 So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near—at the doors! 34 Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place."" Matthew 24:32-34.

Israel is known to be nationally, ethnically, and geographically represented as the fig tree. Their rebirth as a nation in 1948 and the many biblical prophecies coming to pass https://www.signs-of-end-times.com is recognized as the meaning of the parable. Israel is 75 years old this year, in the middle of a generational period. Psalm 90:10 states: ""Seventy years are given to us! Some even live to eighty. But even the best years are filled with pain and trouble; soon they disappear, and we fly away."" From all indications it appears that we are living at the end of ""this generation"" that shall not pass. 

>""The rebirth of Israel as an independent nation in 1948 is one of the most significant events in world history."" ""Five of these seven prophetic events have already been fulfilled, and the final two are certain to follow."" ""The prophet Zechariah noted the following would be true of Israel in the last days: ""I will make Jerusalem and Judah like an intoxicating drink to all the nearby nations that send their armies to besiege Jerusalem. On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone, a burden for the world. None of the nations who try to lift it will escape unscathed."" Zechariah 12:2-3 (NLT).

What the near future is believed to hold based on fulfilled Bible prophecy so far.

>""The tribulation is a future seven-year period when God will finish His discipline of Israel and finalize His judgment of the unbelieving world. The church, comprised of all who have trusted in the person and work of the Lord Jesus, will not be present during the tribulation (Got Questions Ministries takes a pretribulational approach to eschatology). The church will be removed from the earth in an event called the rapture (1 Thessalonians 4:13–18; 1 Corinthians 15:51–53). In this way, the church is saved from the wrath to come (1 Thessalonians 5:9).” Continue reading... [https://www.gotquestions.org/tribulation.html](https://www.gotquestions.org/tribulation.html)

The accommodating nature of the Jewish community in spite of the historic abuses is a testament to the infinite value of our existence.

I see the worldwide antisemitism. The right wing trolls and abusers who come within our communities and spread hate and vitriol.

In spite of this, I see tons of love and unity within the Jewish community! It’s rewarding every day to be amongst you all, in this time in history.

Thousands of years without a home, and here we are around the world, having the option to integrate wherever a fellow Jewish community is on the Globe. From New York To Jerusalem, every single one of us wakes up to different scenarios and struggles, together.

I’m going through a LOT right now, but I do thank G-d for allowing me the privilege I do have. To share a space with such a vibrant and diverse community that’s tied together with the beautiful historic cloth of our resiliency.

I’m proud of all of you for being true to yourself. And to those who aren’t there yet, just wait. 

By Embracing ourselves and our circumstances, we embrace each other, and even further, we embrace G-d.

This is a very special time in history! There’s worldwide suffering that for the first time, we can all see and interact with on a global scale. I am here and ready to stand by you all in your time of need, and by sticking together and staying close to kin, we make sure that the suffering has an end.

Honestly, G-d bless the Jewish community. Many of you have truly touched my heart, and I do wish the best for you all. Just wanted to share my appreciation!"

 I'm going to be doing that in a college (psycho didn't go well), not a university and I was wondering if anyone who have been or know anything about the experiences in Atuda and can share.

Anything will help really because recently, after I've searched if other people recommend it I saw a lot of bad experiences (not necessarily in the degree itself, but after it). Some also said swe is a waste of a year and its better to do a comp sci degree.

Anyhow, because of Atuda, my enlistment is delayed until March, so if I don't get Atuda it might be a waste of half a year, and I can't do יג/יד, since I'm too late for it. I've tried to ask to go for מודיעין, since even with my profile of 72 I did 10 units (יחידות לימוד) of computers/programming but it didn't work(a lot of appeals and phone calls but nah). basically its Atuda or combat, and I don't particularly want to be in combat, I want to use my time more efficiently(I know some people may think that me having this mindset is a bad thing, but I just don't think I'm going to do well in combat, and while i do respect combat very much im not interested in it)

Any advice? I just don't know about things like these and don't have anyone to talk to so I thought I'd ask online and maybe get some help(most likely nobody would see this but it's worth a try right?).

Sorry for the messy explanations"

How much barley do Jews eat anyways? Wheat and rye is for bread, spelt is that sensitive alternative to the latter two, and oats are for breakfast or your kosher haggis. But barley... I don't think I have seen it in many Jewish menus at all. Do you eat barley? I think I bought a bag twice in my life, and it yields a lot of grain for a side dish, but I think I eat a lot more rice/bread/ptitim/couscous/potatoes over all, over barley.

After reflecting, I really don’t identify as Messianic, but align with more of the traditional beliefs because of the mix of what I learned.

In the US, retailers really compete for your business and shopping is super convenient - fast shipping, easy returns, price matching, etc. Here in Israel it feels like the opposite - slower shipping, difficult returns, and I'm always worried about getting ripped off (אני לא נזיר).

eCommerce feels clunky compared to the US and I'm used to buying almost everything except groceries online. Amazon was my go-to with their crazy fast shipping. And if Amazon wasn’t the best deal, a quick Google search would provide alternatives.

So, to all the experienced shoppers out there, how do you navigate and optimize your shopping experiences in Israel? What tips, strategies, or tools/websites do you use to get the best deals and maximize convenience when shopping in Israel? Where do you find the best prices online?

Glglz E/Galatz E plays obscure English songs that no one knows, or Israelis that wail into the mic and call it music. When there's no music, they talk about nonsense.

Kmusic E is all about piano and violin music. Who would want to listen to violins on their way back home?

Eco99 FM is just confusing; I can't even figure out what they're doing. 

Bet E might sometimes be interesting, but they bombard listeners with ads for 20 minutes. 

100 FM occasionally plays good music, but they play 'Vampire' by Olivia Rodrigo at least once an hour, which drives me insane.

Reka E can't stop talking about the war in Ukraine, reciting pointless Russian poems, and playing unfamiliar songs. Occasionally the songs are not bad, but that's rare."

It cost us 2600nis for 3 nights...we would only eat dinner (breakfast was provided by the hotel) because food is so expensive there. It would cost us like 300+ nis to eat out. 

There is the whole idea of having no tax but they raise their prices anyway to match the Merkaz. I mean Zara, castro, fox, factory54 i mean pants were 200nis shirts for 150 nis and what is wild is people are buying, and buying a lot. I thought people had no money and no one can even close the month. 

Also the kids... fuck.. I mean kids crying, yelling, running, the parents buy them everything and they cry when they dont. 

The Adults, smoking drink, throwing trash on the ground, standing in the middle of the street, honking, yelling. 

Dont get me wrong we had a great time, we went snorkelling and if you do go and you dont have kids we found that going out to dinner at around 19-1930 pm is the best to avoid the crowds of 2030, and going to the beaches at around 930am is the best way to avoid the crowds.

So in Christianity it’s commonly accepted that Jewish people worship the same God as the Christian God, with the major difference being that Jewish people don’t accept Jezus’s divinity and anything else being as a direct result of that or also being present in intersect disputes. Many, if not most, Christian’s also believing that Jewish people can even go to heaven just that it’s not as easy without Jezus’s sacrifice which is contrary for Islam, with most Christian’s believe that they worship an entirely different God and believing that Christianity and Judaism are entirely separate from Islam. The reason I’m posting this is because it come to my attention that Muslims also have similar views about Judaism, with many Muslims believing Christianity is the outlier of the abrahamic religions, so what do you think? Do you think Christianity is “closer”? Islam? Are both considered close? Or do you think all of them are entirely separate?"
1,2023-08-13,Should I pay a $50 light rail fine?,u/Jfische92,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/15q6br1/should_i_pay_a_50_light_rail_fine/,"I recently was in Israel for two weeks and had an amazing time for the most part, with a few issues. One was that I was on a light rail in Jerusalem with my brothers. We bought ride cards from the machine, but it was very confusing, as the directions were primarily in Hebrew and the English directions were scarce and unclear. 

When we boarded the light rail, we tapped our cards but they were not validated for some reason. I'm not sure what we did wrong. We later found out our cousins, who were also there, ran into the same issue. A patrol person for the light rail came around and scanned our cards. She told us they were not validated. She spoke very little English, which I understand since this is a foreign country, but it made it harder to communicate. We tried using Google Translate to explain the issue to her, but she still wrote up reports on each of us, saying we had 30 days to pay a fine of $50 US dollars. I wrote a complaint, asking for the charge to be dropped, but it was rejected.

The patrol woman who wrote the reports on us was very cold and stern, and showed no interest in trying to understand or hear us out, no matter what we told her on Google Translate. She asked us for our passports but we had left them in our hotel room because we did not want them to get lost or stolen while we were out. She then asked for our licenses and recorded them. 

While I understand that we are responsible for validating our tickets, I don't think it's fair to penalize us with a $50 fine, especially when the instructions for buying the tickets were unclear and when we did try to validate our tickets.

I was told that if I don't try to pay the fine, it could affect my ability to enter the country again. But truth be told, I don't see how it could since she did not scan our passports but our licenses. The two are separate documents, and I don't think they could connect them in any way. Even if they could, I have another passport as I am a dual citizen of another country, and could just use that to enter Israel again, should I have another opportunity to go there. 

Some Israelis over there told me not to worry or bother paying. One person said she tried to pay online but it didn't go through. Also, they say the patrol people are nasty and mean to everyone, including Israelis, and don't consider the circumstances or listen to your side of the story. I also think the woman could have given us a break since this was our first time riding the light rail over there. 

The system is also ridiculous. I learned that if you buy a single ride from the machine, you are actually just purchasing the card but not an actual ride. What is the point of purchasing a card if you are not going to load any rides on it? Not sure if that's just unclear instructions or how it works over there, but it makes no sense. That wasn't the issue for me, but I just wanted to make a point of how the system is confusing and illogical. 

I know it seems wrong not to pay, but the fee is ridiculous. My question is do you think I should pay or no? "

Wrapping it up she I kid you not turned and swam away back her friends saying this “it was nice to meet you” in a hurried tone. Not labeling them as racists but that was really racist. P.S.

Grew up orthodox, stopped believing in god, starting to rediscover it and I feel conflicted. 


I grew up orthodox in the Five Towns in New York (shout-out to any of my cedarhurst people) where it was very easy to be shomer Shabbos and to keep kosher. I was very into it, I loved Hashem and I loved being Jewish. 

Shortly after my Bar Mitzvah, I moved to Texas with my mom and in the area we came to it became essentially impossible to keep kosher and keep Shabbos. I started going to public school and eventually lost my belief in god. Years passed and my disbelief grew stronger. I got married to a non-Jewish woman and sadly our first daughter passed away at 10 weeks old and instead of just not believing in god, I actively resented the idea of believing in god. Since then my wife and I have 2 beautiful kids. We started going to a reform Shul by my moms house for “tot Shabbat” for my kids and it reopened my eyes, however, conservative and reform should are just not my cup of tea. I find them a little too…performative…if that makes sense. 

I’m now 37 and I just found out a few weeks ago that there is a Chabad only. 5 minute walk from my house. I’ve been going every Saturday and have really been loving davening, the community, and I find engaging in the rituals extremely comforting. 

My worry is that I still feel like I’m not there with believing in Hashem. Beyond that, I’m not shomer shabbos, I don’t keep kosher, and I’ve got a number of tattoos. 

Am I lying to the rabbi? To myself? What if I’m just riding the nostalgia high and I’m not doing it for the right reasons? My wife says if it feels good I should do it, I don’t need any further justification, but I feel like I’m not being honest."

1,2023-08-13,Former Christian Questions,u/ForcibleBlackhead,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/15qcgk4/former_christian_questions/,"Hello all, 

I am a former Christian that sort of couldn't drink the kool aid anymore. The idea of the Trinity and I would be going to h\*ll if I didn't except Christ just resonated differently when someone in my Bible Study asked ""What happens to people, like indigenous members of a tribe, if they die before hearing about Jesus?"" ""They go to hell, or God(Jesus) will find a way to speak to them."" was the common answer. This sounds insane. 

I need some help. So I am trying to get some information on Christianity from the Jewish perspective and I am researching for the truth because I believe in God and I definitely have a feeling that it is Abrahamic centric. I have studied some Islam and asked questions there. 

Is it possible that Christianity just got it all wrong because they were clueless? I have noticed it's very difficult to wrap my head around the New Testament as it's super confusing. A lot of contradictions or vague ideas. 

A guy I am speaking with from my church is sending me all these prophecies, like 2000 have been answered and some about Jesus being the messiah and how he was mentioned in the OT and he met the criteria. I am really frustrated because I have read and even rebutted him with several Rabbi articles where they question this and they always explain it's in the Hebrew and mention the translations have been misinterpreted. But home dude always responds with some cultish response like ""Ours is truth.""

Anyway, I have been to Israel several times and I totally love it there and I am praying to God daily for some clarity. I would convert in a heart beat. "

1,2023-08-14,I found out my paternal grandmother tried to baptize me....where do I go from here?,u/veggietaleprincess,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/15qnznn/i_found_out_my_paternal_grandmother_tried_to/,"It's the middle of the night and I can't sleep. So for context, my mother is Jewish and my father is Catholic, so I was raised Jewish, went to synagogue as a child, I had a bat mitzvah, and I have no connection whatsoever to my dad's religion aside from going to family gatherings on major holidays. My dad's side of the family is large, but all his siblings married in their religion, so my brother and I are the only Jews in the family. However, my dad's mother is *very* Catholic, like ""no hate like Christian love"" religious. She has always had a dislike or at least an aversion towards anyone different from her, so POC, non-Christians (Jews and Muslims mostly), LGBTQ+, and basically anyone who isn't a white Catholic. Most of her bigotry comes from a place of being severely misinformed on the world, so I just take most of what she says with a grain of salt nowadays. I have always personally felt like she wants me to convert and tries to tell me a lot of stuff going on in her church in the attempt to convert me or pique my interest but she has remained unsuccessful.

Last night I was spending time with my cousin and we were having a really long talk about our grandmother and our extended family, and we were talking about the crazy things that she had done in the past to try and push her religion on us (he's not Jewish but we are also both lgbtq). As we were talking and laughing about how nuts she can be, my cousin casually says  ""do you remember when she tried to baptize you?"" and I kid you not I heard a record screech in my head. I was like ""WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!"" and he said ""yeah! I know you probably won't remember it because you were a baby, but yeah, she tried to baptize you in her kitchen sink. your mom was PISSED. did your parents not tell you?"" My cousin is several years older than me so that's why he remembers it happening.

My jaw was on the floor at this point. I had absolutely no idea that this happened, and I know that her splashing water on me in her kitchen sink is not at all what an actual baptism is, but the implication of what she tried to do was there. What did she think, that she could do that and my parents would just be like ""well I guess we have to raise her Catholic now!""? My religion is something I am so proud of, and it is a huge part of my identity, and she tried to erase that in her fucking kitchen sink. I am both shocked and not surprised at all, this is totally something I could have seen her doing, but also it is just so malicious. Knowing her she probably didn't have any malicious intent, but then what could the intent behind that be?

The problem I am currently facing is, how do I bring this up to my mom? Should I bring it up at all? I really would like some kind of closure on this whole thing, just because I never knew this happened. I don't know how to take it, and I am shocked that my parents hid it from me. However, I don't want to bring it up because I think they might have been protecting me from it. Knowing what I know now, I now am wondering if she would love me more if I wasn't Jewish. Any advice on where to go from here would be much appreciated, thank you so much for reading."

So we have been friends since 7 years and all this time she was always very left leaning, I would say her views are very gen z but they were never bigoted. But a while ago she started spreading really weird stuff that kind of seem like antisemitic dog whistles like WW2 is talked about too much, posts on her Instagram saying fuck Israel with a destroyed Israeli flag or when we were on a trip she took a picture of a synagogue that always has to be protected by the police and she captioned it with ""what a waste of money"". But now she gets more aggressive with it, when we were on a trip to Paris last week we passed by a group of kippah wearing men and she a 100 % serious turned around to face me and said: ""If they always behave like this I get why they're hated (it's a bit hard to translate)"".  This open bigotry really shocked me because we're both minorities as well and she wouldn't say that anybody else (She's also member of a diversity club, that heavily promotes solidarity between minorities). And I tried to argue with her about stuff like that, but she just doesn't listen and always brings the slavery argument.
I know that she's really terrible for these views but at the same time she's so kind and intelligent. Does anyone now what I could do in this situation or if I should just distance myself?"

1. Zecharia Frankel in Germany founding the Positive Historical School, in reaction to liberal (""Reform"") German rabbis at a conference rejecting the use of Hebrew in liturgy in . 
2. The founding of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York by Mendes and Morais in 1886 , when it became clear that HUC could not represent all Jewry after the Trefa Banquet
3. The creation of the RA and the subsequent United Synagogue, by Solomon Schechter
4. The creation of the CJLS in the 1940s and their beginning to issue takkanot that uproot some long-held aspect of Jewish law. This marked a clear break between Modern Orthodoxy (represented by the RCA) and the Conservative movement (represented by the RA) as separate streams of Judaism (JTS graduates stopped serving in OU congregations, etc).

I'm wondering how much of a direct continuity there was throughout this whole history, from Zecharia Frankel to JTS, to the RA and the CJLS. Did the founders of JTS view themselves as within the Positive Historical School, or did subsequent rabbis at JTS look back and adopt a similar world view? Was this school viewed as being Orthodox? Did Zecharia Frankel view himself as creating a new denomination? How about Mendes and Morais? Did they view themselves as Orthodox or as members of the Positive Historical School? How about Schechter? And how about the leaders in the 1940s and 1950s that initiated the break with Orthodox?"

When I converted it was with a Reform rabbi, but I tend to lean a bit more Conservative in my practice.
Recently I moved to an area with 0 Jews. None. Zip. The closest shul is 5 hours away, so I've mostly been just practicing on my own- a bit lonely, but nothing I can't handle. For Yom Kippur, though, I wanted to attend services, so I reached out to the Rural Chabad network. The guys I talked to were nice (though there was an awkward moment where I went to shake their hands and they very politely declined for chastity reasons, which stung a little since I'm trans but it was easy to brush off).
The real kicker came when I talked to the Rabbi of the shul I'd planned on going to. He actually had no problem with me being trans, but as soon as he learned I was a Reform convert his attitude totally changed. He assured me I could participate in services, but the implication was that it would be as an outsider and not a member of the community. It really hurt, especially since this is the only Jewish org I have access to, and now I'm seriously considering not going at all and just fasting at home."

I am a  lifelong scientist doing research and also pursue an observant lifestyle, but my problem is that all the major institutions are run by people who don't even believe in the scientific method, let alone have anything I would call an education in science (it would be like me knowing the melody to Adon Olam and claiming to know anything about Judaism). Normally this wouldn't bother me since people can choose their own life paths, but I have noticed that over the past 70 years, modern observant Judaism has ceded ground and institutional power to a type of unintellectual Judaism typically found among Black Hatters (I don't use this term in a derogatory way since this term in my experience is used by their communities to describe themselves). 

I am not saying this all as a blanket statement, but rather that this anti-science attitude appears to be more common among those communities. My problem is that these communities are calling the shots in Israel and increasingly so in the US. 

The easy answer you will give me is that Modern Orthodoxy is my group, but here is my problem. I find that Modern Orthodoxy generally acquiesces to the extreme groups in Judaism and I feel they are an outright threat. MO people may not agree with extreme forms, but many don't seem to realize the threat that the extreme groups pose to their hashkafah and world Jewry. I feel the urge to be part of an observant community that actively wants to push against these anti-science communities.

Maybe I am over reacting. I am trying to figure this all out. But when an observant Jew with power tells me that they actually believe the universe is 5783 years old and that the scientific methods are inaccurate, my eyes roll to the back of my head. Here is where the big problem comes in... How can I respect their intellectual opinions and reasoning if they think like this? How can I give their ideas any value or confide in their judgement? To me, they lose all legitimacy. This results in me questioning my core observant beliefs since the institutions who claim legitimacy are no longer legitimate in my eyes.  "

I also want to acknowledge that in many ways this is very much a first world problem. 

I’m a collector of art deco items and more specifically, antique art deco jewelery. I use the internet to buy from auctions globally and have noticed quite a few auction houses in Germany with really incredible things up for sale. It immediately made me uncomfortable and I realized why: there is a good possibility that any of these items belonged to Jews and were either confiscated from them or sold in desperate times. What if I buy a pair of earrings and they actually belonged to a great aunt or someone else’s grandmother who died in the camps? My dad’s extended family (cousins) all lived in northern Germany and all perished in concentration camps. The idea that people are casually bidding on items that could easily have belonged to them or other Jews like them makes me feel physically ill.

Any other lovers of antiques have similar experiences, or am I just a weirdo?"

The kind of ride where I should take in several hundred calories along the way, or suffer the consequences. And since I'll be out in open desert for a lot of the trip, I'll be eating as I go.

I'm finding a surprising a number of sports bars and other snacks are actually kosher. But that leads me to wonder... What would the technicalities be for eating along the way. When you sit down for dinner, it's easy. Meat or dairy, pick one, not both, blend with parve as you wish. 

But what about on a bike ride? I'm not going to stop to eat. Would cost too much time, and burn energy getting started again. So would that count as one sitting even though it's separate snacks? Or would there be a time period between snacks that makes it a separate meal? I can't imagine it would be kosher to finish beef jerky, then a couple minutes later open a dairy based bar. But it also seems absurd to go 10 hours on only meat or dairy just because my butt is on the same surface."

1,2023-08-14,Prayer is difficult for me,u/w0wc00t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/15r62s1/prayer_is_difficult_for_me/,"**Edit:** Thank you so much for your insight and advice, everyone. This had been incredibly helpful.

It's always been difficult for me. I'm going through conversion. I've been going to my local shul almost every Friday in 2023, and I recently started going to as many Saturday Shabbat services as I can. I've been meeting with my Rabbi who has asked me to write notes about my Shabbat experiences. He asked if studying or prayer is easier for me.

I told him that studying is easier, and it's true. Throughout my religious life, prayer has often been so difficult. I'm not a person who can feel things easily at all. As a small kid, I grew up in Fundamentalist, Pentecostal churches where people would speak in tongues and writhe on the floor when they felt the ""spirit."" It freaked me out. My parents eventually got less and less fervent in their religiosity, and the churches we went to got gradually less crazy. But even just raising up my hands and closing my eyes always felt weird. We became Catholic for a short while, and I fell in love with the rituals/set prayers that were a part of it. I could be dour and quiet and still be doing it ""right.""

I almost never feel anything when I pray- there are some times or occasions where I absolutely do, but not usully. But God is there in my life- I know God exists, but I don't know how God exists, y'know? Is God a feeling? Something from within? To me, it doesn't feel like something I can reach. I'm just not great at feeling positive or spiritual feelings in general- it's hard. Maimonides even said that prayer gets in the way of truth and that contemplating God- thinking about what God is not in silent meditation is the best way to find that connection, and I agree. Deconstructing God is what helped me want to pursue more and what led me to Judaism.

Philosopher Franz Rosenzweig was an assimilated German Jew who nearly converted to Christianity, but he stopped by an Ortho synagogue on Yom Kippur before his baptism, changed his mind, and committed himself to Judaism. But he was against denominations and said that Judaism is beyond rituals, and that to be Jewish simply means you're called from within yourself to delve deeper and deeper into Judaism, making it your lifelong mission to learn and experience all parts of it.

But my Rabbi disregarded that when I talked about it and seems to really want me to get into prayer. I'm okay with that. I'm still learning the prayers, so half the time I don't know what I'm reading, so that's also part of the issue. I'm just afraid that this will be a roadblock in the future. Does anyone else have this issue?"

I got into a debate with a pro Palestinian and one of their main points was that Britain stole their land to give it to the Jews and that Palestine has every right to get all of it back. This was also used to justify Palestines acts of terrorism against Israel.

I’m just curious to see if this sort of thinking is flawed. I’m looking to get info on the topic as well as undisputed facts so I can counter this point next time I get into a debate.

I originally thought that Britain had no intent of giving the land to Jews when they first colonised the area and that they had even rejected the Jews to live there. I thought that they had only given the land to them after the holocaust but again I’m very uneducated and unsure about this specific topic.

1,2023-08-15,Favorite Story of the Torah?,u/UziTheScholar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/15rdhfv/favorite_story_of_the_torah/,"For me, it’s the story of Samson. The idea that with gratitude and discipline comes grace, but loss of focus costing everything. This is very relatable to me. There’s an unspeakable amount of power that comes from within, even further, within Faith in a Higher power. I feel that with the right focus, not obsession, but calm attention, anything is possible.

I see the story of Samson from an angle of redemption: we all make mistakes, some of which cost us greatly. What do we do with the results of our actions? Do we lose hope and break down, or go back to backdrawing board, back to G-d, and regain our focus?

To me, Samson was as True a Judge as it gets. In spite of losing his vision quite literally as a result of his blindness to the troubles brewing around him, he managed to find his way.

1,2023-08-15,"Hate Symbols in a work place, covered with Star if David, I'm still offended",u/Traditional-Elk9978,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/15rdn59/hate_symbols_in_a_work_place_covered_with_star_if/,"

I work at a shelter.

When  I started, one of the residents had a swastika, SS symbols, and 1488  symbols in their room and some other questionable items.

 I  didn't say anything being new but noticed that this was a glaring  issue. Three weeks later another new person noticed and said something  in a group meeting. Everyone who worked their acted shocked like they  hadn't seen it- something that I have a hard time imagining considering  it was there for at least 8 weeks and the participant leaves their door  wide open often, and we are required to do unit checks. It is implied it  will be taken care of in the meeting. This was on 7/26 I believe.

Shortly  after the meeting the swastika has a piece of paper with a Star of  David over it, and one pair of SS'es are removed but besides that it  seems largely the same. 

On  8/6 (I believe) , and I bring it up to my supervisor that it appears to  still be a hate symbol. My supervisor agrees that this is a violation  of the rules, patronizing, harassing, and not acceptable. They agree  that it isn't acceptable according to our safety matrix. They proceed to  seem to do nothing concerning the hate symbols and don't give any  language that they will resolve it.

Most  people seem to be aware that the Star of David was actually popularized  by the nazi's because it was used as a mark to make them the other and  dehumanize them. It became popular to wear them by Jewish people as a  way of trying to take ownership back to their identity. In many ways, it  is offensive to display this symbol when you aren't Jewish, and this  person seems to still be using it in a flippant way. Traditionally it's  not expected that staff explain why hate symbols are offensive, nor need  to explain why when one group use a symbol it is offensive and when  another group uses a symbol it is not.

The  coworker who initially brought it up agreed this was clearly not  alright, and that if this had an LGBT parallel this would not be as  accepted.

I'm  not used to working in shelters where the people with power don't  immediately address it and resolve it, and because I come from a  different shelter environment, it feels like it is not being taken  seriously by most of my team. I recognize it might be a difference in  how they deal with these things but its about how I am feeling  emotionally about this.

To also clarify I am Jewish, though these symbols tend to represent much more to other groups as well.

The  day after, it is not resolved, and I send a letter to the Director of  DEI about what could be preventing my supervisor from doing something.  We have a few exchanges but ultimately, they write:

""I  would say that at the time of report a request to clean or an attempt  to remove the symbol should have happened day of. I would say that  escalating it to the Program Manager would be the next step. I always  recommend issues like this being handled through email that way it is  time stamped and dated.""

While  after I talked with the team on Monday (8/7) a bunch of people seemed  to have movement on the issue, it still stays up. I've explained that it  is a symbol of hate to multiple people, and they seem to understand and  seem to agree. People did not seem to give any push back. This isn't  even controversial, using the Star of David in this way is obviously  hateful imagery. It is a mark of pride for the jewish people and a way of saying ""not ashamed"".

Three days later, it is not resolved.

When  I brought this up to my manager on Wednesday (8/9), they said another  Case Manager and BHS were going to address it today. When I asked the  case manager who they referenced, they said no one told them anything  about this, and BHS went home without addressing it (I think they had a  hard day). The program manager and my supervisor went home for the day  by 4:30 PM. **I don't understand why this isn't up to supervisors to  enforce or safety matrix and to keep the work the work place trauma  informed and not a hostile environment for jewish people**. I'm  disappointed in the lack of movement by my program manager and  especially my supervisor for not addressing and resolving this issue.

On  Saturday 8/12, I asked the coworker who does unit checks and they said  it was still up. They reported that Scott Ellis, their Team Lead,  refused to act on it, saying it was in their unit and that staff should  talk to Aaron.

There  is no documentation of it being handled. The extreme heat recently, the  participant has not been leaving their door open like they normally do  so I have not verified it as of today (8/14).

DEI emailed me and told me I should alert HR on all this and file grievances,

I start the process, and everyone emails me it will be resolved by the end of day.

Before the end of day they email me telling me they made sure all hate symbols are gone, but that the Star if David stays, because the person is now identifying as jewish.

This doesn't make any sense to me, and seems like the typical Nazi twitter nonsense. Its offensive to me that someone who just a week before had 1488 non-sense and on their wall now gets to have a Star of David up. The person looks like a cartoon character of a neonazi. He is obviously not even pretend Jewish, but I am told we can't make him prove he is Jewish. Its very obvious from his actions before being asked to take down the Star of David he was behaving like a racist.

I am beyond offended. What is my best course of action here?"

Well the current Hebrew year is 5783, and 5784 begins next month, so the implication here is that the Moshiach will arrive within the next 17 years.

When I heard this recently for the first time it honestly shocked me. Is this really a widespread belief for religious Jews? The person who told me about this informed me that it's written in multiple places in Jewish texts, and that they see it as reality that the Moshiach is guaranteed to come in this lifetime. The belief also entails that if every Jew is not following the Torah before the Moshiach arrives, then the Moshiach will bring about the end times through violent means instead of through peaceful means. So is it really common Jewish belief that 17 years from now the entire world will enter into a state of war?"

The soldiers get in a tussle with a group of Palestinians, and the rifles simply hanging on them without a purpose, making their work even harder.      
If they are doing policing, then they should be equipped qs policemen. A gun in a holster is enough, and rest of the equipment should be non lethal aids, handcuffs, pepper spray, a baton perhaps, and that's it. No need to carry big ass useless m16 rifles that get in the way.    
BTW I'm against the Israeli presence in WB, but if they are there then at least they should be equipped with the right gear to carry out their duty effectively, it will be better for all parties involved. "

I saw many westerners and muslims jump to defend Palestine while spreading hatred against Israel and Jews.

As an Indian, I understand the position Israel is in.. infact I commend Israeli people for their resilience. Israel today has so many enemies, nearly most muslim countries want to erase Israel and take away what Jews have accomplished there. And many in west blindly support Palestine while maligning Israelis and calling Israel a fascist country. 

cross-border terrorism is a huge issue here in India ( thanks to the failed terrorist country of Pakistan as our neighbour ) ..we have had many terrorist incidents in the past and Israel too has been facing similar terrorist activities. 

I have heard about the huge accomplishments of MOSSAD and how they foiled many dangerous operations against Israel in that region. 

Today India's biggest threat is China, border disputes with China have become common occurrence including China making a claim on India's north eastern territories. China actively seeking to derail our development also blocking our change of being a permanent member of UNSC.

And there are other issues like islamic radicalism, illegal muslim immigrants from Bangladesh- Burma and more.

Sometimes when it all seems doom and gloom, i think about Israel ..how despite all the odds it still manages to stand strong and it inspires us. The tale of Israel is not that of fascism but a tale of heroism & resilience."

I felt like I was everyone else - born in the same country same culture except for the religious bit but you were treated differently often. So on that level I can understand it. Is this just antisemitism internalized? She believes all the nasty things like excessive frugality she said to me she can’t believe she dated a jew. For many reason but mostly anti semetic I am no longer friends with her. She even would call people a jew as an insult. Yet at the same time she calls herself a certain European nationality which was on her side Jewish and I pointed that out. How do people like this make sense of the world?

However, seeing as how the global Jewish community is in a different place than it was years ago, and the Israeli government is ... otherwise occupied, do you think history could go differently this time around? 

I read months ago that in the interest of verifying who to bring to Israel from Ethiopia, the Israeli government was assembling something akin to a Beta Israel Bet Din. (Can't for the life of me find where I read that.) Well, the current Beta Israel population in Israel is pretty assimilated, but who's to say that the influx of new Ethiopians and a slight institutional backing couldn't snowball into an institutionalized Beta Israel Judaism? I think it could actually attract disaffected Jews from other backgrounds, like Karaite Judaism has been doing recently. What do you think about the likelihood of something like this happening?

Anyways,

My family (from both sides) are bulgarian jews, which are generally considered to be sephardic jews, well not all of them but the most of them are considered to be. AFAIK at the best time of the Jewish community in bulgaria the Ashkenazis were aboyt 10% of the whole community and because they were a much smaller part they kind of got absorbed into the sephardic community. I've been told that Ashkenazis from eastern Europe have been moving there due to the ottomans who ruled the land at the time were treating the jews pretty good, at least better than most European countries.

Recently I've been very interested in jewish history, and especially the one of my own family in bulgaria. 
I tried searching in Google the origins of both of my parent's surnames 
My father's- Mashiah (משיח)
My mother's- Melamedov(a) (מלמד/ובה)
When My mother made her Aliyah in 97' they made her drop the Slavic suffix 'ova' so she stayed with melamed.

So anyways, I couldn't find anything really about my fathers surname 'Mashiah' , and it's really a bummer because this is a really interesting surname, and although I'm not religious in the slightest, it's really interesting to know where the name comes from.
But I don't really question the fact that it's probably of sephardic origin because it does have the sound to it.

About my mother maiden name 'melamed/ov/a' , I thought the same until I tried searching a bit in Google about it as well (couldn't say I found much, but a bit more than I could find about my fathers.) 
I found that there are a lot of ashkenazis with the same surname - Melamed, Melamdov/ich.
And couldn't find anything really about any sephardic people named Melamed.
I always new that Melamed is someone that taught the children Torah and talmud and these stuff, but after some research I found out that a Melamed is exclusively taught children in the Ashkenazi ""Cheyder"" (חיידר, חדר, I'm not really sure how to spell it in English).
After thinking about it with my mother she did say that it could make some sense, because before moving to Sofia in the 20th century, she could recall that the Melamed/ov side of her family had lived in Northern bulgaria, near the border with Romania (which is considered to be pretty much ashkenazi) and in general if an ashkenai from eastern europe were to migrate to bulgaria he would come through the northern part of bulgaria.
Furthermore, I couldn't find neither Melamed nor Melamedov in any of the Spanish/Portuguese residency lists which state the surnames of those who are eligible for residency in those countries to the expulsion from Spain in 1492.

That is really confusing because we were always considered to be fully sephardic, but couldnt really find too much about this.
BTW the maiden name of my mother's mother was Isaakov/a which also sounds ashkenazi, but again, as far as we knew, they were supposedly sephardic as well, but again all of the Isaakov's I could finds were ashkenazis. 

If someone knows anything about this and can help/educate me it would be great! Thanks in advance!"

I am referring to a less mainstream media definition of Satanism. I have friends who call them selves Satanic because we bonded over music (if you guessed it: yes, metal music). They explained to me mostly how Satanism is about justice in the world and not allowing others to cross your boundaries and serving as their doormat, but that this doesn't mean to be spiteful and always planning revenge. More like: putting yourself first. Caring about your loved ones because, seeing them happy also makes you happy and therefore you more or less have egoistic altruism in it. So it's not about not caring about others at all. My friends see it more as a metaphor, some of them like the devil's depictions because they're a little bit of edge lords (mostly against militant Christians who try to convince everyone or exclude outcasts, big topic), but they don't take it literally. They don't participate in any slaughter type of rituals and whatsoever. I don't fully understand, but at least from my friends it seems like more of a philosophy of life rather than religious belief.

Do Jews coexist peacefully with Satanists like any other religion, or are they frowned upon a lot?

My friend and I fucking stupid and didn’t know before arrival that public transportation isn’t available on Saturdays.

Anyhow, we are currently in Netanya. And our flight is on Saturday afternoon… how do we get to the airport the cheapest way possible? Are there any sheruts in this city? How do I get more information on this topic? We have to pay 120€ if we use the hotels shuttle or the taxi. 

Are there any Facebook groups where people get together? Anything? We are in need.

It largely exists to serve Christians, which makes sense, but I think the way it’s done is naive and always slightly reeks of evangelizing . I also kinda think that it offers naive solutions to antisemitism. Most of the dialogue I have read or watched has this idea that if Christians understood the connections they shared with us 2000 years ago they won’t hate Jews anymore. It seems silly, I feel like it only makes ‘good’ Christians feel better about themselves. We’ve also seen a rise of antisemitism in America which I think highlights some of the flaws."

From the Israeli side, it’s the settlements and all that encompasses. (To me it seems like this could be solved at least theoretically, should a non religious moderate coalition form)

 From the Palestinian side it’s the opposition to the idea to a two state solution. (I think Jerusalem and refugees could be reasonably settled within a two state solution).


My question to moderate Palestinians here is:

1-How significant within Palestinian population is the opposition to a two state solution?

2- If it is indeed significant, what alternative realistic resolution would most Palestinians accept? (By realistic I mean something that most Israelis could accept as well.)"

But here i was disappointed because of many things

1. Laws
Laws here are so strict and you can do ± nothing to your car

2. Freedom(?)
While im driving here i dont feel any freedom, i dont like Israeli roads and i feel like there is no interesting places that i can go so i basically feel that owning a car here is kinds pointless even tho i bought a car not only for getting from A to B.

3. Community
For me, i found some really nice people in Russia that im really comfortable with even tho we can only talk online, but here i feel like i cannot find someone that im comfortable with because i feel like everyone here is the same and they dont idk have that special chill atmosphere.

As someone with a deep interest in the complex tapestry of Middle Eastern cultures and histories, I've often wondered about the perspectives of Lebanese Jews, especially those who now call Israel their home. Lebanon, with its rich history, diverse communities, and mesmerizing landscapes, has undergone numerous changes over the years. Amidst these shifts, the Jewish community, once a vibrant part of Lebanese society, has dwindled significantly.

I'm reaching out to the Lebanese Jews in this community to share their thoughts:

1. **Emotional Ties**: Do you still harbor a deep connection or love for Lebanon, despite having left? Would you ever consider returning, even if just for a visit?

2. **Perception of the People**: What are your views on the Lebanese people? Are your memories of the country filled with warmth and camaraderie or overshadowed by the challenges you may have faced?

3. **Cultural Identity**: How do you preserve your Lebanese Jewish identity while living in Israel? Are there particular customs, foods, or traditions you still hold dear?

4. **Political Views**: For those comfortable sharing, what are your thoughts on the political landscape of Lebanon, both historically and in its current state? How has your perspective been shaped by your personal experiences and the trajectory of the Lebanese Jewish community?

I truly appreciate any insights or personal stories you're willing to share. Understanding the diaspora's experiences and sentiments can provide a richer understanding of the region's intricate narratives.

Thank you in advance for your openness and honesty."

I am appalled that so many of my fellow Europeans willingly ignore what the terrorists are doing to your country in order to get high on a made up moral high horse but there's also those of us who are very well aware that if it wasn't for your country keeping Islamic terrorism in check, we'd be in a lot more trouble.

Since he wouldn’t give me my luggage back and refused payment via the app even though I told him repeatedly through the journey I was only paying via the app, I called the police. The handler was sympathetic and said they weren’t busy and would send someone.

After an hour they still hadn’t turned up. At the time, Gett wasn’t open as it was early morning, so I was with my wife and child in Haifa being blackmailed by a taxi driver do my luggage. We had been travelling all night so I consoled myself that the driver wasted an hour of time and paid his ransom of 700 shekel to get my luggage back and put all of this behind me. Complaining to Gett afterwards was useless. After some pushing they offered me 15 shekel in credit “for your next journey” as if I’m ever going to use the app again.

What should the price for this journey have been, roughly? Aside from not taking a taxi (train only for me from now on) what would you have done to handle the situation?"

For example, I’m pretty sure last years Ramadan there was a video going around in Al Aqsa mosque of soldiers beating up some people. Sounds terrible right? 

It was later revealed that there were bombs / Grenades / weapons hidden and ready to use on the night of Ramadan. 

However, nobody seemed to be talking about that. Does anyone acknowledge this or is it more comfortable to hate on them instead of another serious problem, Hamas.

Since having to move due to rising rents, it feels like keeping kosher is my main tie to being Jewish while I'm ""between synagogues,"" but I recognize now that I definitely also have some kind of contamination-based OCD. 

Our kitchen sink isn't kosher because of my non-Jewish roommate's cat food and treyf silverware for takeout. We have a basket in our sink to put kosher dishes in, but sometimes when we run the sink it gets filled with water that mixes with food left on the dishes, and then my contamination OCD is repulsed by how food-water has been syagnant in a bucket for some time and I avoid it. I've come to dread cooking/dirtying dishes so much that most of my meals are instant, takeout, or nonexistent. 

Does anyone have suggestions for making this setup mentally or practically easier?
(I *am* looking for a new therapist; my current one for my other neuroses hasn't been much help and I'm fearing that a non-Jewish OCD therapist won't respect the idea of keeping kosher since it's now tied in with OCD. :-/)"

From what I knew being Jewish is a person who practices Judaism.

Is it a race also? When people say a person looks jewish I think to myself. “They just look white to me”.

My confusion also grows when people like Drake are half Black Half Jewish.  His Mom Looks White to me.

Also how is that different from practicing Judaism?

You can be ethically or racially Jewish without being a religious Jew, right?

What Natanyahu wants? To stay in power.     
In order to stay in power he has to build a coalition with haridim.    
What haridim want? Exemption from military service and welfare payments for yashivot students.    
What prevents from haridim to get all that? The Supreme Court that deemed those benefits to be unlawful.    
What is there left to do? To take away the power from the SC in order to pass those discrimenatory laws that favor the haridim over the rest of the population.  Here enters Natanyahu.     
So we are doing 1 plus 1 plus 1, and we conclude that the real reason for the judical overhaul is for Natanyahu to satisfy the haridim on expense of the rest of population so that he could stay in power. "

I'm heavily considering leaving but I kinda feel like I'd be cutting off my nose to spite my face. 
I understand that for many this isn't a problem and I'm not even sure where I draw my line. I wouldn't marry a patrilineal Jew, but id count them in a minyan. So maybe I just need to suck it up."

1,2023-08-16,Last Thursday Mahmoud Abbas dismissed about 12 governors. Why?,u/OttomanEmpireBall,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/15sgf4e/last_thursday_mahmoud_abbas_dismissed_about_12/,"I’ve been reading about the upheaval, and the whole decision seems pretty random. I’ve read that the governors were caught off guard by their dismissal.

The Governor of Jericho himself, Jihad Abu al-Assal, admitted he didn’t understand why exactly he and his colleagues had been dismissed.

Obviously trust in the PA is at an all time low, especially since Abbas has suspended elections out of fear that Fatah would loose again (similar to the 2006 legislative elections).

So what gives? The overhaul likely won’t change Palestinians’ attitudes or relationship with the PA, and with Hamas already moving forward with elections in conjunction with the CEC, it seems like too little too late."

As of late, I’ve noticed Gen Z/Millennial “influencer Zionists” so to speak (think TikTok, Instagram, etc.) really dig deep into this idea that all Jewish people are an indigenous people. I think this is slightly flawed. 

I’m Ashkenazi. I acknowledge that all Ashkenazis, including myself, can trace our ancestry back to the Israelites. But, at the end of the day, our ethnogenesjs occurred in Europe. Israelites migrated to Southern Europe after the exile, converted local southern European women, had children, and then these children continued marrying exclusively within the community which created a genetic bottleneck. After several upon several generations, the Ashkenazi ethnicity was then born and we spent the next 2000+ years in Europe. 

The Israelites were indigenous, sure. No debate there. But can I with absolute confidence claim to be indigenous too? I’d say no. Instead, the most I can claim is that I am an ancestor of indigenous people. Perhaps for the Mizrahim who never left the land, it’s a different story.

My point is that I don’t see this as presenting any sort of conflict with being a Zionist and expressing support for Israel. I’m open to hearing debates on this below."

Let me reiterate, we are the only Jews who would be in attendance. 

I'm sick of this shit. Who are you to say ""oh it might be offensive"" in front of the only people you're saying might get offended by it??? You don't get to decide what's offensive and what isn't. If you aren't Jewish, you don't get to speak for us. Simple as that."

Mid 20s, started going out for a few weeks with an old friend I went to (a jewish) high school with.
So as it turns out, her family story is interesting and she has one Jewish grandparent (mom’s mom) but of course grew up Jewish and feels very much so.
This doesn’t bother me at all, especially considering how she grew up, but my only concern is in terms of possible marriage, would it be difficult to be married Jewishly since there are obviously no ketubot for her parents or moms parents. (Her parents immigrated from the former Soviet Union thru Israel)

I dated a non Jewish woman for a while and a big concern was my kids not being considered Jewish, and this was very difficult for me. 

I was feeling OK about this situation and of course still getting to know each other more, but was asked if this concerns me by family members and feeling a bit weird. I feel like this isn’t really something simple to “solve” at this stage and don’t want to just give up because of this if it’s ambiguous. I feel like I’m also over thinking this a lot.
I live in a city with a very big Jewish community."

It is just to discuss the discourse on the topic in the way I will describe below. This post is mainly targeted to people living OUTSIDE Israel/Palestine. 

People active in this community are probably also active on other social networks regarding this topic ( and maybe in orgs too ) . It may seem that it’s a topic that most people care about and are passionate about, but it’s not really the case. Such social networks act as a bubble as you might tell. Even opinion polls in the US and other countries about which side do they see more favourable or their opinions on BDS and the Apartheid accusations have a significant percentage of ""don’t knows"" or ""neither"" or ""both"" or some other variation of no clear opinion … it is also fair to assume that people that do say that they are in favour of one side or the other , are not all so passionate about their opinion or informed enough, instead it’s just a general sentiment. 

I have previously read about political behaviour, a main point is:  When it comes to foreign policy topics that don’t affect the population directly , people that are NOT informed about the topic,  create their opinions by: either adopting the opinion of the political party they already support or based on personal values . By the second , it means the following: ""i love democracy"", ""I do not support attacking civilians“, ""i hate violence "", or maybe the opposite too for some… so if today a Palestinian attacked an Israeli civilian , they would voice pro-Israeli comments and if tomorrow an israeli attacks Palestinians, the other way around … ( surely VERY dependent on what news they are receiving )
More permanent shifts come when a new war breaks or when a human rights org reveal something new … but again not very substantial shifts…
They do not see it in terms of ""self determination "", ""colonialism""… and other concepts as people more informed do . 

SO , my main question is , for people that live outside Israel/Palestine how does it feel talking to other people/friends that are not as knowledgeable and opinionated as you about the topic , what is usually acceptable and what’s uncommon  ? Do they feel like it’s a sensitive and controversial …? Do you feel it’s changing in the last few years ?? ( I would appreciate if you state which country u live in)( and again note that I not referring to media and politicians )

I would really love to hear from those that do not live in a western country nor in an Arab state , how is the discourse in your country ?"

It's only my Orthodox friends - I know a lot of non-Orthodox Jews and people who aren't Jewish and I've never seen someone else do this.

Where did this come from? Was this a thing before Facebook? I initially thought it would be to help people pass the seven days leading up to the wedding where the bride and groom won't see each other, but I've also seen people do countdowns for more than just the week leading up to the wedding and I'm super curious."
1,2023-08-16,Why is the left threatening violence in their protests?,u/somedaveguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/15sr125/why_is_the_left_threatening_violence_in_their/,"Here's a quote from a recent article about protests demanding light rail service on shabbat. I read a lot of this kind of language with the judicial protests. It promotes public violence in the name of policy change. 

I understand that (here) the protesters' goal is to have the train run on shabbat, that their complain is that the quality of their day is diminished by the lack of public transportation. But the decision to not have public transportation on shabbat is the product of the democratic system, not of some authoritarian individual. 

I don't understand why threatening to steal the happiness of other members of the public is an acceptable approach towards resolving their disagreement. 

[Tel Aviv Light Rail to Operate for 43 Minutes on Saturdays] (https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-08-16/ty-article/.premium/tel-aviv-light-rail-to-operate-for-43-minutes-on-saturdays/00000189-fd40-dd4b-abcd-fd7576b10000) 

**""If we don’t have a light rail on Saturdays, you will have a rough Saturday too.""**

Is that really the kind of democracy the left is shouting for? The kind where a vocal minority gets to override the democracy through violence? A state where the public (voters) will be harassed until policy is changed? 

Not a pretty picture."

1,2023-08-16,"""Just be a secular/cultural Jew""",u/StarryStudent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/15ss00y/just_be_a_secularcultural_jew/,"I'm a convert to Judaism. For the first couple of years I was quite observant, kept kosher as strictly as I was able to, studied Torah and gemarah, and was a regular attendee of the shul I went to at the time. 

Flash forward to nearly 5 years later and I'm just not as religious as I once was. Maybe it will return, but maybe it won't. 

When I talk to those born Jewish about this, I'm usually met with: ""Then don't be religious, just be culturally Jewish""

I don't think a lot of Jews-from-birth realize how hard this can be. If someone is raised religiously Jewish but then becomes secular, they at least grew up in the culture. Judaism isn't what I grew up with. It isn't core to my childhood memories, influence me during my most formative years, or shape the foundation of my worldview as an adult. 

It's hard to fall back on something that in many ways is still foreign to me. And if I'm losing the religious connection to Judaism, the key reason why I converted in the first place, then what is there for me to hold on to?"

1,2023-08-16,My experience in Jerusalem,u/CornelQuackers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/15stdj4/my_experience_in_jerusalem/,"Hey I wanted to share my experiences of Jerusalem this past weekend and gauge some general responses from locals to see if I got a good experience. Sorry in advance it’s a miniature essay so those who don’t want to read a lot TLDR: I loved the city, it’s history and the people although had a few bad experiences but didn’t completely sour my entire visit.

In terms of getting there I went via train from Tel Aviv’s southern station which I forget the name of to Yitzhak Navon station on Friday morning. Fairly surprised at how infrequently the trains would be running to Jerusalem. I’d assume they’d have more regular service for tourists, soldiers and locals to access the city. 

Using the tram to get to the old city was interesting due to how crowded it was and was surprised at the way people pushed on before people got off. Back in London we’re taught to wait for people to get off then you get on. 

As for the old city…it hit me on a different level. To be clear I stayed in the Armenian quarter at the Emanuel center. I’m not a fan of their organisation and felt bad giving them money but I couldn’t afford any other place in the old city and didn’t want to attempt to walk from west to east on Saturday. The staff were friendly but some guests seem to be taken aback when I wore my Kippah. Understand why but frankly glad they left me alone. Plus I was mostly wandering the streets.

The streets like King David street and Chain Gate are the perfect picturesq depiction of the “typical Middle Eastern bazar” sellers crying out in Arabic, Hebrew, basic English and even heard some French. Interesting smells and popping colours as herds of people brushed past each other. I mainly spent my time in the Jewish quarter to be more in touch with my roots and easier access to kosher food. 

The Christian and Armenian quarters were fantastic to explore from a historical perspective, seeing the walls and ramparts, holy sites to Christianity, going out of Zion gate to David’s tomb. However I wish I could have explored the Muslim quarter but as I got closer to it I felt uneasy and like I was being watched. I understood before arriving that the Muslim and sections of the Christian quarter would have more sympathy or attachment to the Palestinian national identity but never assumed even an English speaker who wasn’t born in the land would be made to feel as if I shouldn’t even go near the Muslim quarter. Even outside the walls going to the Damascus gate I had the same reaction. 

I don’t want to be completely unfair to the local Arab inhabitants and do believe I had prejudicial thoughts going into these encounters. There were Arab merchants who did try to get me to buy their wears. I said no and upon the conclusion of our interaction I did wish them Salam Alaikum to which they wished me the full Alaikum Salam back even upon seeing my Kippah. But I’m not sure if local Israeli Jews here felt the same unease as I did towards going to the Muslim quarter of the city.

The Kotel was my favourite part of the whole experience. I went multiple times across Friday to Sunday night. Something internal just kept pulling me back. Security was easy to understand and very patient with explaining to me the procedures so I could follow them correctly. But here my pride in being Jewish fully exploded. Seeing ultra religious Jews and secular Jews side by side at the wall. Soldiers and civilians in the evening’s performing the hora and singing classic songs. Multiple minyians and their own Torah scrolls. Touching the wall is something I’ll never forget. Like time stopped. However I wished they’d warn about pigeons pooping. Got pooped on twice. TWICE. Not saying the pigeons need to be cleared out but perhaps a heads up to let both sections know they could potentially be pooped on. 

My only downsides was in the Jewish quarter a old man basically blocked me until I agreed to be “shown to a historical site” then pay him. At the wall on Sunday morning a religiously conservative man struck up a conversation with me only to request charity. And at the wall a man who was in a form of religious ecstasy was dancing, singing, clapping but clearly disturbing multiple individuals including myself. He fell over my table when people approached him to ask him to be more quiet but I believe security should have come to remove the dancing man. It’s good to dance and sing if it helps you feel closer to the divine but if it’s interrupting and disturbing others who get that same connection via more quiet meditation style practices isn’t fair towards them

Back to the positives. I got to meet Rabbi Tovia Singer on Friday night and ask him a question which I’ll never forget. Met a Chassidic man on Saturday called Eliezer, he gave me bread, helped me with the proper way to wash the hands and had a fascinating conversation. Back to Friday night as I was leaving the Kotel I bumped into a man who saw I was wearing a Sudra in the evening as I could feel the breeze. We chatted then started a small moment of singing which helped fill the streets with songs as we all made our ways back to our accommodations. 

The food, except for Saturday daytime I ate exclusively in the Jewish quarter. All the food was divine. I don’t care if a hamburger cost 35 NIS it was extremely tasty even when I was physically full I devoured this thing. It was from the BBQ place outside Hurva Synagogue 

Besides the few bad apples mentioned earlier everyone. Jew, Arab Christian, Arab Muslim was very helpful towards me and pleasant. Accepting of the fact I knew very minimal Hebrew and basically no Arabic. If I knew more Hebrew to catch all the slang and subtle details plus all the money in the world I’d happily move to the old city.

What would be fantastic is the Israeli government and or any Palestinian authority, yes i believe the entire city should be Israel’s capital but taking into account international politics many nations believe the city should be divided, should publish some form of Autistic/Aspergers guide to visiting Jerusalem because i can sense many autistic people getting led astray by phrases like “it’s free to look, come and look” “I was selling this for X amount but for you I sell it to you for Y amount” and “I’m from here I can show you around the city” setting the entire conflict asides individuals with autism like myself should be given a fair lay of how the culture works so we can function individually and be less likely to be taken advantage of."

Im a young male (in my early 20s) with a Muslim background. I’ve been raised in Germany however it was still quite a mix between liberal schools and a quite liberal society on the one side, and a deep Islamic-conservative, politically right-wing on the other. 

Eventually, I realized I was gay and I went through a long struggle. The religious matters, family’s expectations, the burden of being different/gay in general and also depression and lack of self confidence, for which I also attended therapy for several years.

I’ll eventually be able to live free in a few months to study in another city and in recent months, I’ve already dig deep into Judaism, talked with people on a server, read through articles, conversion experiences, but also negative/""the other side of Judaism"" i.e. on r/ExJew on Reddit. 

After I have kinda lost the connection to Islam, and I felt lost, I discovered loving Jewish communities that don’t reject me for who I am and that allow me to be connected still with G-D.

I’m just a bit unsure about this all in general. Is my soul really Jewish? Is this just a trauma response of me? What if I’m on a wrong way?

Is here someone who was in a similar situation ?"

In 1984, my father, a then young man, spent some months living in the Tel Yitzhak kibbutz. He speaks so fondly of his time there even now, almost 40 years later. The experience helped shape him into the man, and father, he is today. His birthday is coming up and I'd love to surprise him with a gift that would remind him of the time there. I'm thinking of having a photo printed and framed.

This might be a long-shot, but I'd be forever grateful if someone here has some photos from around that time they'd be willing to share. It doesn't need to be a photo of the kibbutz necessarily, perhaps someone has an old photo of the nearby beach or just a photo of the city itself would be amazing.

I made bread with sorghum flour this week which was tasty enough, added one extra egg, but it was still super crumbly. Going to try doing half and half with rice flour next time but also curious if people have suggestions? In theory you can use wheat flour as a binder and keep it shehakol but having a hard time figuring out how much is the max amount for binding since anything beyond that makes it motzi. 

I'm using bread really loosely here--basically a grain (or lentil tbh) based bread-y thing. I'm also a fan of a yellow mung bean pie/bread thing I make so any suggestions or recipes would be much appreciated! Thanks!"

I've been looking hard at my choices in this regard - two serious relationships ended, plenty of shorter flings - not a lot of happiness resulting from any.

I've decided never again to make myself less to fit what some random man wants from me. 

I've realised most of these encounters have left me feeling sad and violated at worst, distracted from what matters to me at best. 

So maybe - maybe the more observant approach is good? Maybe physical intimacy is best left til the intentions of a relationship are properly established? Maybe there are parts of myself (physical and emotional) that I can keep private, not because I'm told to, but because I'm doing what's best for myself?

I don't mean I'd jump into following lists of rules, which tbh are pretty foreign to me. 

But has anyone come from a mostly secular background and ended up in a more considered approach, informed to some extent by an interest in more learning/observance?

My partner told his stepmother about it. And her reaction was that I needed to let ""Jesus into my heart"" or something like that. OK, she's 80+ Whatcha gonna do? 

But it did sort of surprise me because she did marry a Jewish man (my partner's father).  He died a few years before I met my partner so obviously I never knew his father, but I knew his dad wasn't observant in adulthood and hadn't raised my SO as...anything. SO's mother is also not Jewish.

(Just to note, I'm converting for me and me alone. But having a dual heritage partner means he's happy enough to be a secular partner in a Jewish household, and he's supportive of my journey and changing our cycle of holidays and sometimes attending and even enthusiastically volunteering at shul. He is not converting with me.)

We had dinner with her tonight. I was sort of dreading it, but my plan was nod and smile. Nod and smile. She didn't say anything awkward and about halfway through dinner she said ""\_\_\_ told me you were interested in Jewish culture, so I thought I'd give you this..."" 

She handed me a bag with my father-in-law's talit, a siddur given to him on the occasion of his bar mitzvah, challah cover and a very fancy kippah that I assume was from his bar mitzvah as well. I was really touched. I mean, it was just truly lovely and I was thinking about all the events in future we would be able to use some of these items and honor my partner's father and his family heritage. Like maybe in our wedding or the first time I receive the Torah, you know, special occasions.

Then she said ""I'm not using them anymore anyway. We used to use them for Christian Passover at my church.""

Oh.

Nod and smile. Nod and smile. 

And on the way out she said ""They're not pressuring you to convert are they?"" I told her that wasn't the way. ""But they probably want to share the joy like we Christians do."" Nod and smile. Nod and smile. I told her my congregation was very welcoming and let me share in the joy.

And finally... ""They know you're just taking the classes because you're interested in the culture right?""

Nod and smile. Nod and smile.

My partner said I should have told her I was just there for the codes to the space laser."

First of all, I do feel bad for Palestinians and the way they are badly treated by the Israelis (according to the human rights reports and the documentaries, it's not my opinion).

Palestinians don't deserve to be killed, your houses demolished, your women raped etc.

I have one problem, though.

A chunk of my favorite rock musicians are Jewish (namely the bassist, keyboardist and a singer of my favorite band Rush).

I don't wanna sacrifice this, despite the fact Roger Waters from Pink Floyd supports your cause and I think he is right, even though he supports Russia, weirdly.

How do I cope with it?

BTW I'm from Poland and most Jewish people think ethnic Poles collaborated with Germans en masse and I think it's Russian misinformation against Poland. Although I'm tired of my fellow Poles getting defensive, when they are faced with I guess mostly true accusations made by the Jewish community.

EDIT: I got called out by an another subreddit so here is the thread I made and no Pole responded:

The Russian state channels spout a lot of propaganda, fake news, deny accusations, call everyone Nazis (us too ofcs), and discuss in talk-shows with joy about nuking European capitals.

If we leave all that, the worst part is at night where they dabble in anti-Semitism like Jewish groups & Rothschilds control the world or speculate about 9/11 or Covid or the cabal or more conspiracies that are usually associated with people who couldn't finish high school.

This is the first jarring candidate for a Hebrew name, being that it establishes a clear personal connection to me, however with the name not being of Hebrew origin I’m skeptical.

I moved to Israel and made a beautiful new friend group, and things have just been clicking into place WAY too easily and I can't help but see hashems hand in it. It's totally not logical, and totally emotional - and I never had this kind of faith before. It's really great to really BELIEVE 

I was ffb and it's been really good for me to actively choose to become more religious, and to actively choose to make brachas, put on tefflin , keep kosher etc. 

I have been thinking about what I want in a new marriage, and what kind of family I want to raise. And I want to raise a family that truly believes that every person has their own personal connection and journey to Hashem. And that Hashem created all religions as a means to connect to him in a different way ( not necessarily that all religions are ""Correct"" but that all religions were created by god, and all humans are created in god's image)

Here is my issue, I know I am not ready for marriage yet, I'm still working on myself in alot of ways, but especially religiously - but I miss having that emotional connection with someone , and the physical connection as well. 

I have only hooked up with my ex-wife, she was my first and only gf. I have an urge to at least hookup with someone, or date someone for fun - but at the same time I feel like it would be really nice if the next girl I hooked up with would be my second wife, I really do like the idea of Shomer negiah and I believe that sex is very emotional for me more than physical

Is waiting worth it? Is it really better to hold off hooking up until I'm married again? I really feel like I would enjoy at least hooking up with a future gf, but I'm terrified of building a physical/emotional bond with someone and then losing it again. I was really really happy that I only had sex with my ex-wife, but now I feel like I already ""broke the seal"" so does it really matter if I hookup more before I get married in the future?

I don't even want a one night stand, I want to find a nice girl and just cuddle and enjoy eachother's company, and maybe more. Or should I just be more strong willed and decide that I'm only going to hookup with my second wife? 

Sorry if this was confusing, pls send any thoughts or advice my way :)"

As far as I can tell the roots of the argument is in a report from 2022 by yediot achronot ([this one](https://www.yediot.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-6180621,00.html)) which is pushing the agenda of q group called [free Israel](https://www.facebook.com/bfreeisrael/photos/a.677051782335035/8052692881437518/?type=3) whom had ordered a reaserch from [Chen Herzog](https://www.facebook.com/bfreeisrael/videos/%D7%97%D7%9F-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%92-%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%9F-%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99-bdo-%D7%9E%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%9C%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%99-%D7%9B%D7%A5-%D7%91102fm/622397215896899/), there are other reports that were made at the time but this is by far the one that everyone are quoting with the number of 17.4 billion shekels of loses during the next 40 years. Sadly most of the points here are misleading at best and blantly wrong at most.

Let's start with the first argument, according to "" them"" the cost of a ticket every day will have to increased to caver the inactivity on shabat, they even give numbers, an increase from 13 to 15 shekels.

 First of that's not at all how economy work and because we are in 2023 and have the data of the ticket price we can show that it wrong as the cost of the most expensive ticket is only 12 shekels so **anyone who's quoting this data (and those are everyone) are spreading misinformation**. Even if this somehow was correct it's still won't be an economical loss as they just moved the ""lose"" of people who'll pay on shabat to people travelling not on shabat and that's not anything.

The second point is that without using the ""efficient"" light rail people on shabat will use more expensive mods of transportation (cars and taxis), the third point is that the activity of the train in shabat will make 9,500 cars to ""be put off the road"". 

This is a better argument and I cant really argue about the numbers here (because I can't find them) but it isn't a loss for the open public like they present it to be it's a lose to a very specific part of the population(and using the light rail in shabat isn't a nasesity because no one work on shabat so you can just sleep all weakend and achieve the same thing) presenting it as anything else is misleading.


Personally I support the activation of the light rail on shabat but the economical arguments here are coming from manipulativs groups who are twisting the data and not sharing the exact methods of the calculations, I don't support this."

I just graduated high school this June and have been in a program called Garin Tzabar where they help foreigners enlist in the IDF. It is now August and the program starts soon, but I am having some second thoughts about it. The reason I am joining the Army is mostly because I want to experience the life of being a soldier and being more connected to Israel, but it is also because my sister is currently in the army and I know having her around with me will further help in my decision to stay. Awhile ago I had my friends in America cry and told me not to go. This really broke me and now i’m just not sure anymore. If I go, my ties with them will surely disappear. I am also half Israeli and half Asian (I look asian). I have no problem with speaking hebrew but everywhere I go in Israel i’m treated like a foreigner. Israelis speak to me in english and I would have to speak in hebrew back for them to get the idea right. I’m scared that the fact I look asian will also cause annoyances during my service. If you are wondering why my sister is doing just fine, it is mostly because of how she grew up. She grew up in a more white/israeli household where my dad would enforce us to speak in Hebrew (she also looks white). But I grew up in a more asian community and household since my dad has gotten older and has become less strict about having an israeli identity. If I join the army i’m surely going to miss out on growing up with my friends back at America, but if I do choose to go to college, I will be forced to take a gap year since the school year is starting, and my sister and dad will for sure be disappointed in me since they have hyped this idea up to our family and friends for years now. What do I do?"

I honestly couldn’t name the last person in his family who was actually Jewish but I look up the name and the history is there, meaningless (due to its patrilineality) as it may be. We didn’t go to temple, or do anything even remotely Jewish besides play dreidel around Hanukkah/Christmas time, and my dad was raised in the church of Christ so idk what business he had saying this stuff. I took a great interest in the Holocaust, Hanukkah, incorporated all this into school history projects, and basically identified with it despite not being actively Jewish at all in any capacity. 

Started a job when I was 18, met this woman named Zelda who actually WAS Jewish and told me Jewishness is matrilineal. This is when I started to be like “oh I’m not Jewish”. Despite not knowing basically anything, this still felt like a loss? I was butthurt over stolen valor basically. At this point I started really heavily researching alternating points of view on Judaism as an ethnicity/religion and those intersections. Actually started learning the important stuff, tried to have these conversations with my dad, but he was always very dismissive and it was becoming clear to me he actually had no idea what he was talking about. 

Since that point I have seriously considered converting to Judaism. I was always violently opposed to Christianity since I was about 8 because of kids at school proselytizing (grew up in a very evangelical community) and was an avowed atheist until very recently. There are parts of Judaism that align well with my values and worldview, other parts not so much but I think that internal
discourse is part of the deal. I have read Diamanit’s book Choosing a Jewish Life and it moves me to tears for some reason. 

Anyway, I started really reading about two years ago, and in the meantime my father has said that he’s “not really that Jewish”
Great, glad you figured that one out while my grandfather has doubled down on it. My cousins recently went to Prague and they gave my male cousin a head covering so he could enter a historic synagogue, which he brought back and gave to my grandfather. It’s a disposable head covering made for passing tourists. I really don’t know what to make of this. They have a Magen David fridge magnet from when my grandfather’s second wife went to Israel with her catholic church group. My grandfather doesn’t go to church but he also doesn’t go to temple. Now that I’m writing this all out it seems worse. 

I sent an email last week to a Reconstructionist rabbi asking if there was a good time for me to attend Shabbat and get a feel for the congregation but have heard nothing back. My aunt is friends with a rabbi and I asked if she would be willing to connect us so we could talk but she seemed unsure with the idea. Basically it feels like maybe it’s time to back off and maybe this isn’t the right step. I’m afraid that I would be converting because of insecurity and imposter syndrome and not for the right reasons. I have days when I feel so ready and days when I feel the opposite. Apologies for the rant, any and all challenge or criticism or support is welcome."

Sure, we call it out, call it what it is. That just leads the antisemite to say “well, I’m Jewish, Soo…” as if their talking point isn’t racist/bigoted.

“DO LEFT WING JEWS REALLY RUN ISRAEL?” The Wisest Right Wing Jewish person said once, as we watch Israel burn itself rather than passively allow a right wing takeover of the country by right wing Haredim and Bibis Coalition of Exploitation.

And they could not fathom how antisemitic is my is to realize that Jews aren’t always the supervillain of the story! And to point out leftist Jews as if the issues are caused by too much freedom and voting rights.

I don’t care what political beliefs you have. I do care if you’re an antisemite who happens to be Jewish, spreading talking points the equivalent of Schutzstaffel dog whistles.

If The Jewish left had more power in Israel, the REAL left(those who care about asserting individual rights amongst a collective well maintained society), Israel wouldn’t deprive power away from the people.

See how all the major countries on earth are successfully tricking millions of people to buy into Right Wing nonsense, so much so that to be Jewish is no longer enough. As if it ever was: having an opinion is one thing. But to spread vitriolic ideas under the guise of “opinions” is dangerous.

Jewish unity means putting terrible political beliefs aside for your fellow human.

It means realizing your problem as a Jew is your lack of vision in regards to politics. The solution to oppression is freedom through mass mobilized and coordinated action. If you believe the Leftist Jews run the media, how does that impact your daily life? What will you do to positively make change?

What it’s Not, is being a Right Wing Jewish person saying “perhaps we DO run the Media…”

Weak Hearts breed Weak ideas. 

Whatever conclusion you come to, make sure it’s well researched, non-speculatory and doesn’t sound like it came from a 1930s book from a genitally frustrated Austrian man."

1,2023-08-17,Separating ourselves by denomination - why?,u/beanepie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/15ttsze/separating_ourselves_by_denomination_why/,"I’ve been thinking about how so many Ashkenazi Jews classify themselves by the type of shul they go to. I’m orthodox, I’m reform, etc. 

I grew up going to orthodox yeshiva and an orthodox shul (modern for both) but my parents really could not have cared less. We kept a kosher home for my grandfather and by kosher I mean we ate take-out treif with paper and plastic while only cooking kosher food. We shopped on Shabbat, watched tv, etc. 

BUT when we did anything religious we did it orthodox. Still do. 

I’m currently mostly non-practicing personally (keep somewhat kosher- can’t do the pig or the shellfish) but I LOVE Judaism. I love the culture and my heart fills up with joy when I’m at my brother’s for Shabbat and my little nieces and nephews tell me what they learned in school about the parsha, etc. 

So… what am I? Quite honestly, I feel no need to classify myself beyond “Jew” which I am through and through. But if someone wanted to know my denomination would it be non-practicing orthodox? That sounds kinda silly.

(Also, I try not to think how the not doing when I know what I what I should be doing could catch me end…)

I guess I’m wondering why we classify.  Is it so we know someone’s level of observance? Because while I used to think “reform” meant not observant at all, I know “reform” Jews who paid a lot more attention to Shabbat than my family ever did. 

I wish we were more like Sephardic Jews. They all go to one shul whether they’re planning on going home after services to a Shabbat meal or out to a baseball game. 

Anyway, I’m crazy tired today so hopefully this makes sense to someone."

I have many mixed feelings, mainly due to the fact that I am very observant already and feel like I'm starting over, if anyone has advice about dealing with these feelings I'd love to hear it!!

I haven't come out about my desire to convert, especially not to my parents. And since I am a minor [17] and still at home, I can't exactly do much in terms of practicing (ie. keeping Kosher).

I want to begin my official conversion when I go to college, but I feel like a part of me is missing when I read/hear about all of the beautiful practices that exist, but I can't participate in.

Does anyone have any recommendations for small acts of faith/spirituality a teen stuck at home can do before/to prepare for an official conversion? I'm not too sure what sect I want to convert to, but I feel extremely drawn to Orthodox Judaism, if that helps any suggestions.

I (31M) am a single guy living in NYC. There are no shortage of Jews here, and I am also very involved in the Modern Orthodox community, as that is how I was raised. It sounds very simple to find another Jewish person to date, but there is such a wide range of practices, even within a single subset. For example, many Modern Orthodox people keep all the laws fully, but some, like myself, may generally observe Shabbat and kosher but will sometimes use electricity on Shabbat or occasionally eat at a non-kosher restaurant (usually sticking to dairy/fish products). To the people with stricter observances, this is akin to being non-religious. But to someone raised without religious practice other than maybe the high holidays, hearing that someone spends their Friday nights at Shabbat dinners, even if they will use their phone, is like ""dating a rabbi"", as some women have put it to me.

This disparity makes it very confusing to date people. Firstly, the supply of Modern Orthodox people who were raised like I was (going to a yeshiva high school, etc) is really not that large. At 31, I feel like I've already met everyone in my age bracket. The apps are the best way for me to find dates (by setting the filters to Jewish Only), but most people I've found are not from a religious background, and the mis-match of practices as well as uncertainty about what kind of home we'd have if we were married has caused these potential relationships to not work out, even if we have a good connection. I'm honestly not sure myself which way I want to go. I do like the warmth of the Shabbat table, and I do think there is a lot of benefit to being involved in a religious community, but I don't like how restrictive it can be or how it can feel like you are being forced to do something based on what you were taught from an early age. I'm still trying to work out where I want to end up, practice-wise, but I don't have the answers yet. The one thing I know for sure is that expanding my search to people who did not grow up Modern Orthodox gives me a lot more options. It just comes with a lot of extra confusion.

Do any of you relate to this experience? How have you navigated it? Do I need to come up with a clear answer of what I envision my future household to look like first, or is this something I should be able to work out with someone over time?"

It seems as if non-Jewish groups today tend to vilify Jews or not consider us as being a group that faces racist or oppressive attitudes because of the assumption that all Jews are rich or that we're part of the grand global conspiracy (still waiting for my phonecall guys, if you'r reading this). 

I'm wondering when attitudes, or if they ever did, begin to shift in this direction where Jews are effectively lumped in with the ill-defined and amorphous group of ""White People"" that represent the ruling class in America? 

If being conflated with being ""white"" is perhaps too far, then when do you think Jews in America were no longer treated as a minority in the sense that we were, are, and likely will continue to be an oppressed group and a target of parts of the cultural majority?

The reason I ask is mainly based on how Sandy Koufax was perceived when taking days off for the High Holidays and how that was received."

|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recruitment and Hiring**                   | Overseeing the overall process, ensuring compliance with state laws, coordinating with departments | Conducting interviews, selecting candidates in line with departmental needs |

| **Employee Conflict Mediation**              | Handling serious disputes that may lead to legal issues, implementing conflict resolution policies | Resolving minor conflicts and disputes between team members |
| **Performance Evaluation**                   | Coordinating and maintaining overall performance evaluation system | Conducting performance evaluations for their team members |
| **Compliance with Labor Laws**               | Ensuring company-wide compliance with federal and state employment laws | Complying with labor laws at a departmental level |
| **Compensation and Benefits**                | Administering company-wide compensation and benefits programs | Recommending raises or promotions within the department |
| **Termination and Disciplinary Actions**     | Handling terminations, legal compliance with terminations, company-wide disciplinary policies | Managing disciplinary actions at the department level, initiating termination processes |
| **Health and Safety Regulations**            | Implementing and maintaining company-wide health and safety policies | Ensuring adherence to health and safety protocols within the department |
| **Handling Discrimination/Harassment Claims**| Investigating and resolving company-wide discrimination or harassment claims | Reporting and assisting in the investigation of claims within the department |

These distinctions aim to prevent overlapping or contradictory actions and to establish a clear chain of command within the organization. It promotes accountability and allows for specialization in areas where specific expertise is required.

Maybe the problem is the Palestinian side is now so interested in the Palestinian state, talking with random Palestinian about their own state and government always bring up negative reactions like ""fck Abbas, I'm not gonna pay taxes to nobody, why would I?"" Why would you? Because if you'd like to build your nation/state that's what you do, you put your efforts all together as a nation and contribute to the collective, but it seems that the Palestinians lack this understanding or maybe they are not interested in it at all?

Anyway, the way I see things 2 state solution has been a fact for long long time now and it is probably a failure, maybe because of the Palestinians perception as I tried to describe above, and maybe for other reasons, between them Israel and the Palestinian society division between those who support Hammas and those who support the Palestinian Authority.

1,2023-08-18,Proposal for an Israeli caste system,u/Joe-586,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/15u4j3l/proposal_for_an_israeli_caste_system/,"Hey all, a few posts back I discussed the idea of creating an Arab underclass. It was meant with quite harsh criticism, however not many (especially Israelis) know that a far more radical system has been implemented elsewhere, for three millennia - yes, three ***THOUSAND*** years. That would be the caste system in India.  


The Indian caste system is a social hierarchal system that has existed in India for centuries. It categorizes people into different groups, or castes, based on their birth. These castes are thought to be determined by one's karma (actions in past lives) and dharma (duties in this life). The caste system traditionally has four main categories (varnas) along with numerous sub-castes within each category. The system was originally intended to promote social harmony by assigning specific roles and responsibilities to each group. However, unfortunately it has also led to discrimination and inequality over time. Discrimination based on caste has been outlawed for a while, and there are reservation practices in India - essentially affirmative action - that have tried to reverse this but it still has a massive effect on Indian society today. 
  

  
Here's a brief overview of each major caste category:
  

  
Brahmins:
  
Brahmins are the highest caste in the traditional system. They were considered to be scholars, teachers, and priests. Their primary duty was to perform religious rituals, study, and educate others.
  

  
Kshatriyas:
  
Kshatriyas were the warrior and ruler caste. They were responsible for protecting the kingdom and maintaining law and order. Their role included leading armies, governing, and making important decisions.
  

  
Vaishyas:
  
Vaishyas were the merchants, traders, and farmers. They were responsible for economic activities such as agriculture, trade, and business. Their role was to provide the society with goods and services.
  

  
Shudras:
  
Shudras were the laborers and service providers. They supported the other castes by performing various tasks like manual labor and services. Their role was to assist the higher castes in their daily lives.
  


Dalits (untouchables):
  
Historically, they were considered outside the varna system and were subjected to severe social discrimination. They performed jobs that were seen as ritually impure, such as cleaning and handling waste. 
  

  
This caste system has had a significant impact on Indian society, influencing social interactions, marriage choices, and access to opportunities.

Now while I love the general idea behind this, theres a few issues I have with it.  


* It's rooted in religion. I'd like to think of myself as a hyper-secularist for Israel so I'm not interested in implementing any of the more draconian laws of Judaism onto Jews or non-Jews.   

* It's far too fixed. I don't believe people born into different social/ethnic groupings should only be forced to work a job for the rest of their lives. Instead of jobs being assigned to different 'castes' in Israel i think certain policies/laws/taxations/attitudes should be assigned only to different castes. 

&#x200B;

* I'm not interested in upholding such a policy for the rest of eternity. I'm interested in assimilating Arabs eventually so that such a sytem isn't needed.  


Until that comes arond, I propose an Israeli caste system we could implement.   



Tier 1 - Secular Jewish Israelis.   


A uniform tax rate of 15% for all Jewish citizens that would gradually decrease to \~5% in a few decades time. Only grouping allowed to become PMs or heads of government. Strict rulings on them to prevent them from the possibility of them flocking to other countries in the future.   


Tier 2 - Moderately religious Jewish Israelis that are not Ultra-Orthodox or Hasidic  


Have a uniform tax rate of 15% for earnings just like Secular Jewish Israelis that decrease to \~5% in a few decades time. Only allowed to become MKs, ministers and members of ruling coalitions, not PMs. Less strict rulings on them to prevent them from flocking to other coutries.   


Tier 3 - Ultra-orthodox/Hasidic jews  


Excluded from the Knesset and national elections as a whole. Not allowed to participate in the national governments. Limited local elections allowed. Same tax policy for them, but moderately subsidized housing in Judea and Samaria that is not very luxurious, harsher sentences for refusing to serve in the IDF (religious reasons to be respected less than moral/humanitarian reasons, although both should ideally be punished). Special courts, transportation, resorts, prayer times at the Kotel, driving licenses, ID's and passports.  


Tier 4 - Loyal Secular Arab Israelis.  


80% of all earnings/income made by Arabs over 8,000 NIS per month to be taxed, taxing 20% of all earnings made under that per month. Not subject to change. Respectable Arab housing units similiar to 'commie blocks' to be subsidized by the Israeli government in full in the Negev. Excluded from the knesset, government and elections until further notice in the future when Arab loyalty to Israel is cemented en masse. Local elections allowed. Special courts, transportation, resorts, perhaps taxed a bit higher for a little while for refusing to serve in the IDF but no serious jail time. If they do decide to serve they wouldn't be serving for very long. Seperate driving licenses, ID's and passports. Lower minimum wage.   


Tier 5 - Moderately religious Arab Israelis.  


Same tax policy to apply. Live in seperate comie blocks built and maintained to the same standards as their secular counterparts also in the negev. Excluded fully from the knesset, government and elections be it local or national. Special courts, transportation, resorts and scheduled prayer times in Jerusalem. Not punished pretty much at all for refusing to serve in the IDF. Access to northern Israel (i.e somewhere past Beersheba) to be heavily restricted. Car ownership to be banned due to car ramming attacks and the potential for cars to be used for malicious terroristic religious fundemnatalist purposes. Lower minimum wage.   


Tier 6 - Ultra-religious Arab Israelis/Arab nationalists  


Same tax policy to apply. Live in slightly more run-down and less well maintained commie blocks in worse landscapes in the Negev but fully subsidized by the Israeli government. Also excluded from all governments, politics and elections. Banned from leaving most of the negev (with some exceptions to be approved) or going anywhere near border areas. Land, property and car ownership to be banned for them. Restricted from serving in any policing/military positions at all. Can only be employed in governmental jobs that have them interact exclusively with other Arabs in the negev. Far Lower minimum wage than secular or moderately religious Arab-Israelis. Special courts, transportation and resorts as well as rare scheduled prayer times in Jerusalem. Courts to be headed by secular Jewish Israelis. Special ID's and passports, give intellectually-inclined Arabs with a potential of high-earnings streamlined visa application processes for long-term visas to a handful of countries where the countries can be paid to monitor their activities, increase tax policy for earnings abroad and if they refuse to comply with the tax policy abroad extradite them to Israel to be punished. Stricter laws and punishments to apply. To be living under martial law, a fairly sized special unit to police their commie blocks. 
  


In a few decades or a century under this new system Israel will become a mixed and secularist technologically advanced nation that incentivizes religious fundamentalists into becoming secular or pushes them out creating an almost utopic society.

I'm a Muslim doing a bit of light research on Kosher laws. I follow the Hanafi school of thought within Sunnism and we have a strict requirement that the name of G-d must be pronounced at the time of slaughter of every animal. This is extended to consuming food from the people of the book, i.e. yourselves

Does anyone here have an expansive knowledge over the different methods of kashrut slaughter across the spectrum of judaism? I'd like to know specifically if there exists a ruling that G-d is invoked on every single animal - not just at one stage of the process.

I was recently watching the TV show ""Suits,"" and I have to say, I was kind of taken aback by the portrayal of supporting character, Louis Litt. He's the pretty much only explicitly Jewish character in the show\*. And the way they write him is something else. They portray him as way over the top nebbish, neurotic, constantly scheming, and weak in a way that reinforces some of the most painful stereotypes about Jewish men. What's more, his role is primarily a foil to the masculine, blonde haired\*,  smooth talking, Harvey Specter, who, despite being a similarly skilled lawyer, usually gets the best of Louis by virtue of his superior charisma, integrity, and unflappable confidence. In the rare cases where Louis actually shows off his legal prowess it is almost exclusively in the realm of, I kid you not, finance. His specialty in finance is prominent enough that it is a pivotal plot point multiple times. Enlisting this help is also pretty much the only thing that causes Harvey to show any Louis any respect. The rest of the time they seem to pretty much show Louis seething in insecurity and plotting ways to climb to a higher position in the company. This isn't to say that he's never given a sympathetic portrayal, but there are some pretty wild stereotypes being used out of the gate. 

I initially thought it was a pretty cut and dry case of antisemitic undertones (like the Harry Potter goblins or whatever) but since the show's writing overall was quickly getting too stupid to even half pay attention to, I just moved on with my life. I started thinking about it again when I saw the Bernstein controversy taking over the internet. I hadn't ever heard a peep about antisemitism in Suits, even though it's one of the most popular shows on TV. When I looked it up to see what people were saying, I was surprised to see that almost nobody was talking about it. All I could find was [this](https://this-is-not-jewish.tumblr.com/post/40695689712/ive-been-thinking-about-louis-litt) obscure old tumblr post, which said much of what I was thinking and more (although more eloquently, I recommend reading it), and a [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Was-the-portrayal-of-Jewish-corporate-attorney-Louis-Litt-in-the-TV-show-Suits-anti-Semitic) question with one response. The single reply notes that, surprisingly, not only are both the actors who play Louis and Harvey Jewish, Specter is a Jewish surname. 

So what do we do with this? Certainly neither would be the first Jewish person to be involved in a production with antisemitic themes, but it's definitely not nothing. To be honest, I'm not sure what to make of it. How about the last name? It seems like Specter is usually a Jewish name, but not in all cases. I it's not the kind of name that would make the average viewer assume Harvey to be Jewish--especially when his potential Judaism is NEVER referenced. At the very least, it's worth noting that both I and the author of the previously mentioned Tumblr post (which appears to have had quite a lot of thought put into it) initially assumed that Harvey was a gentile. The show goes out of it's way to bring up Louis' Judaism multiple times, if they wanted to portray Harvey as Jewish, why never mention it? If you ask me, the dichotomy of traits between Louis and Harvey occurs, for all intents and purposes, between a Jewish character and a gentile one. 

From a certain viewpoint, I feel like it doesn't really matter whether the actors were Jewish in real life. The reason that art, especially storytelling, is important is because it allows us to convey meaning in a unique and unbelievably deep way. The medium allows for unconscious associations and thematic implications that have the ability to convey entire worldviews that could never be exhaustively explained in a literal way. At the end of the day, I think the average viewer is very likely to believe that Harvey is not Jewish. Because of that, to most people, the foil relationship between the rival characters is thus: Louis is pathetic, emasculine, neurotic, greedy, and Jewish. Harvey is secure, masculine, honorably determined, and white. 

Obviously this isn't going to cause mass conversions to neo-Naziism, but associations like this in media are genuinely meaningful and I think we ought to be conscious of them. Then again, I don't want to be too dramatic. I severely doubt that many (if any) of the people involved in the creation of the show are trying to put hate out into the world, but in this instance, the portrayal seems pretty over the top and I really think it could've been avoided. I think it's important to discuss these things, because that's how we improve them. For example, I think it's pretty unlikely that the props department on Maestro was perpetrating a conspiracy to portray Jews offensively, but we still talk about it because tapping into stereotypes can be harmful even when there's no ill intent. I'll add that, personally, I found myself way more hurt by the implications about Jewish masculinity in Suits than by that ridiculous plastic triangle they glued onto Bradley Coopers face--and that's coming from a big nosed, Jewish composer in Boston (although I'd prefer we'd refrain from both). At the very least, I thought a shot at a third mention of this topic on the internet. 

Maybe I'm totally off base and that's why there's so few, it's very possible. What I described here is only my best attempt at approaching something I found to be problematic. If there's a better approach or a reason it's not really problematic, I'd obviously like to know. I also just want to know how other people felt. I should also disclaim that I haven't watched every episode of the show, less because of the antisemitism and more because it kinda sucks, but every single thing I could find online says that Harvey never identifies himself as Jewish. I also know that Louis' personality changes a bit towards the end. I watched some later episodes, it's really not that enormous--nor would a change in personality  towards the end invalidate my points about the majority of the show. 

&#x200B;

\*I think Daniel Hardman is the only exception to this, as he is shown wearing a yarmulke. But I wanted to focus on Louis here. Suffice it to say that the only other Jewish character being the season 2 villain who slyly takes control of the doesn't help matters. 

\*As I mention later, the actor that plays Harvey is Jewish. Obviously blonde Jews exist and I'm not trying to reinforce stereotypes here. In this section, I recount my first impressions of the show (and how I expect many viewers would perceive it). The fact is that, due to stereotypes and its relative rareness, most people don't associate jews with blonde hair. If the show took a second to have Harvey mention being Jewish, as it does multiple times with Louis, I would be praising it for representation. But because they chose not to, it reinforces the dichotomy that I discuss in my conclusion. It's also worth noting that, due to a mistake by the hairdresser, Harvey's hair is much darker in the first season.

Years ago I converted, I started as Orthodox, but for a lot of reasons I ended up converting through the conservative movement. I did it for myself, because of my personal beliefs. It took me years and a lot of study. My sister, Sarah was there at the Mikvah with me when I converted.

She’s marrying a Jewish man, and she told him on their first date that she would be willing and happy to convert. 

So today, she went to the Mikvah herself and converted! When asked by the Beit Din, why she wanted to convert, she mentioned me, and that ever since I had converted she had thought about it, since she agreed with my reasons. 

It makes me so happy that I now have a family member that’s Jewish as well. I’m planning on moving to her area soon, so it will be super awesome to have a home to go to for holidays (her future in-laws)."

Full disclosure, I am a Christian but trying to understand something I read from a Jewish source that I CANT FIND AND IT MAKES ME SO SAD.

I find it really hard to become friends with non jews due to cultural differences, and it’s because of our strict traditions. 

Examples include not being able to go out to eat because the restaraunt doesnt abide by Kashrut laws, not going out on Sunday and taking days off for Yom Tov etc.

Whenever I try to invite people to my home, they feel awkward with our culture and get a bit put off because my family and myself are proud pro Israelis etc.

It's important to note that our travellers will meet every place and person with an open mind and heart. Maybe the worst circumstances can hide the best adventures? Some examples: A mud spa in Finland, a Kyrgyz wax museum where the figures doesn't really look like the celebrities like they're supposed to - and the worst pizza restaurant in Naples, Italy.

From the latest data it looks like there are 11 million Palestinians. 6 million live in the diaspora so they have effectively removed themselves from the ""arena"" as it were. By setting Gaza adrift another 2.5 million Palestinians could be considered to have joined the diaspora as they are now off in their little enclave walled off from everything else. From a numbers standpoint that one move meant that Israel halved the relevant Palestinian population.

Following the Gaza model of packing as many palestinians into as little land as possible to maximize gains it seems the next logical moves would be to use settlements and other methods to herd Palestinians into Ramallah and a few other population centers and then spin them off into their own independent states by walling them off creating their borders for them.

Considering these factors, it seems sensible that Israel should drop a few nuclear bombs on the entire Middle East (Israel reportedly has at least 200 war heads, which should be more than sufficient to do the job). 

They can start with Gaza, since it’s the most densely populated area in the world, two small bombs in its center should be sufficient, and would spare most of Israel from any radiation effects. 

The best next target would be Beirut and south Lebanon. The goal being s to knock out Hezbollah leadership. A nuclear bomb on the Dahiah neighborhood would surely kill Nasrallah and co. And a small nuke near the Litani River would stifle any fighters in the south and likely prevent any rocket launching towards Israel. Again, most radiation would not hit Israel.  

Finally, a bomb or two on Tehran would destroy the regime there and eliminate the Iranian threat. 

Seems like a no brainer."

He also affirms that at the eve of the abolition of the distinction between purely Christian families and families of Jewish origin (more than 2 centuries after they were forcibly converted), a solid majority were still practising it. That seemed to be a hard to believ assumption, since their practice of Judaism would have been totally oral and there was not a single case of reverted Jews back then.

Question for y’all about Hebrew names!

**\[Quick content warning – briefly mentions attempted murder.\]**

Backstory: My biological parents had a turbulent life, so they haven’t been around for a long, long time. In fact, when I was about 4 years old, my bio mom put my siblings and me in a car and tried to drive us off a cliff (*yikes!*). We were saved at the last minute, though, and none of us were injured. After that, I was fortunate enough to be largely raised by my paternal grandparents. 

My Hebrew name is  יִצְחָק (Yitzhak). I think it’s an fitting name, given the circumstances, haha.

However, I never learned my biological parents’ Hebrew names, and my grandparents don’t remember them. Where would I look for something like that? Or, on the other hand, is that even something I should look into?

Thanks for everyone’s consideration!"

After the Ottomans lost the war, Britain occupied the southern parts of the Levant and Iraq. Iraq was created as a banana republic and to keep it weak, Britain took away parts of Basra and gave it to Kuwait so it would have a very small coastline. Palestine was partitioned from Jordan because in case Jordan wanted to unite with Iraq it would still have a very small coastline.

Britain knew that Arabs would eventually want to reunite which would mean that it would lose access to Iraqi oil, so they helped the Zionist settlers in Palestine to eventually create a demographic shift as Palestine is located between the Maghreb and the Middle East. 

Israel acts as a blockade and is basically the west’s right hand to control natural resources in the region, the US gives billions to Israel to be able to sustain itself, otherwise it would collapse.

If there was no Zionist movement then the British themselves would have created a white settler-colony in the name of Christianity to control Iraq’s oil.

Palestinian and Iraqis will continue suffer for the sake of oil and gas until people wake up and realize that Israel isn’t the true enemy, but the real enemy is western imperialism.

She then questioned why I wasn’t allowed to work on Shabbat and said “well if you use your phone why couldn’t you work”. To which I responded I will be spending it with my family and she replied “well they can come in to help too” The comment rubbed me the wrong way and I don’t think she meant it offensively but I left the office feeling kinda weird about it.

I have been looking into certificate programs but really want to put religion as a top priority so I need to be able to have a schedule that accommodates the Sabbath and the high holidays once I am in the thick of the conversation process. 

Eventually, I am willing to finish up my college degree if need be but hoping to just cash flow it.I’d like a certificate so I can finance my life better, which includes conversation class, books and all the other expenses that come with converting to Judaism. 

Does anybody have recommendations, ones based on personal experience would be great. Thank you!"

I'm currently reading the novel *Only Yesterday* by Israeli writer Shmuel Yosef Agnon, who was an Orthodox Jew and whose works and style were heavily influence by Judaism and the language of the Bible.

Throughout Agnon's works, when a character has a dream, he describes the ""Master of Dreams"" as causing or bringing dreams. 

Here's a line featuring the term from another Agnon novel, *A Guest for the Night:* 

>""Before I went to sleep I knew that I would not get through the night without dreaming. And so it was. I myself opened the door to the Master of Dreams, that he might come and provoke me. But I overcame him, and left him behind — and I arose and embarked on a ship full of Jews, old men and old women, lads and maidens. Never in my life have I seen such beautiful people \[...\]""

**My question: What is the origin of this concept of the ""Master of Dreams"" and who is he?** 

I understand it's likely from Judaism, but I haven't found a clear explanation of it. Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

1,2023-08-19,How should I deal with my antisemitic grandma?,u/nohuckleberry3853,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/15vakdc/how_should_i_deal_with_my_antisemitic_grandma/,"Hi, everyone! I apologise in advance if this is not the correct sub for this type of question.

So, some time ago, I visited my grandma. My mother is Russian (she isn’t sure, but she thinks they’re of Slavic descent) and her mother, my grandmother is Russian too, while my father is Jewish.

We were having a small conversation and were talking about my father. My grandmother as far as I know never really liked him. At one point in our conversation, I said that I’m “at least as much Jewish as I’m Russian” (if not more, cause I always felt more Jewish than Russian) to that she replied “well I hate Jews, just like your mother does” (um, the fuck?! my mother does *not* hate Jews) and added “no, you’re Russian”.

I’ll put it this way, that is not fucking nice. You know, I have a Jewish grandma and having heard stories about the holocaust and how she was treated very very poorly in the Soviet Union, the Jewish part of me is not particularly happy with those comments of my Russian grandmother. Besides, she’s also talking shit about my father, which is rude to say the least.

The weird part is despite saying that, my Russian grandmother still hugs me and usually is friendly (albeit sometimes can say some other weird shit).

Their side of the family (including my mother) always said how I didn’t look like them and that I took all of my father’s genes, so…if they (excluding my mom) hate Jews, they also hate me…

I haven’t talked to her in a month and I’m not sure what to do with this. Just suck it up and realise I can’t prove her wrong? I mean, what tf can I even prove? She’s an old woman. Maybe cut her off completely?

Sorry if this is some small issue blown out of proportion. Maybe I’m a snowflake or something.

Thanks for reading this!"

Surely after the beginning of Christianity the entire drama was fresh on the collective minds of the Jews for the decades to come. The Messiah was expected to free Israel from their colonizers, the Romans, which didn't happen. Surely the Israelites were pretty anxious to see this happen which led to the rise of the Zealots which instigated the war. Menahem ben Yehuda, one of the leaders of the Zealots even was proclaimed to be Messiah. We all know how that turned out and I think that the advent of Christianity played a direct role in it. Later, during the Byzantine-Sassanid wars, the Sassanids conquered Jerusalem and put the Jews in charge. They quickly started to rebuild the Temple but when the Byzantines re-conquered that territory the Christians tore it down and turned it into a garbage dump."

While it appears that the Israeli/Palestinian conflict isn't about religion, Palestinian extremists often quote and use religious extremism as reasoning both to fight (resist), remove the fear of death and de-humanize the enemy.

While there are around \~2 billion of peaceful Muslims, the Islamic religion reputation suffers from the extremists few (the Islamists or fundamentalists).

Examples of religious extremism:

# Foreword

[We've had a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/q3g13q/through_arab_eyes_06_is_jerusalem_really_a_holy/) about the traditional Muhammad's history. This post is about the historic Muhammad.

The historic Muhammad is different from the traditional Muhammad and we'll go over the research findings of the historic Muhammad. About 200-250 years separate between the two characters & testimonies.

&#x200B;

**How do we know about the historic Muhammad?**

There have been testimonies written during his life time by non-Muslims (mostly Christians) and non-Arabs at the time and therefor are more objective then the traditional one.

&#x200B;

# The Traditional Muhammad

* [Sira - Muhammad Prophetic biography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophetic_biography) 570 - 632
   * [Ibn Hisham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Hisham) \- Died at 830
   * [Ibn Ishaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Ishaq) \- Around 767
* Hadith - Islam oral tradition. A series of documents connected by a delivery chain ([Isnad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith_studies)) that ties them to Muhammad.
   * 1.5 Million Hadiths but 3 main collections
   * [Muhammad al-Bukhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Bukhari) \- 810 - 840
   * [Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_ibn_al-Hajjaj) \- 821 - 875
   * [Imam Al-Tirmidhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Tirmidhi) \- 824 -892
* lived about 200 years after the death of Muhammad, they originate from the [Zoroastrianism Paras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism) far from the [Hejaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz) / [Hejaz Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hejaz) in Arabia
* The Islamic traditions ([Sunnah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnah)) where concentrated by the historian [Muhammad Al-Tabari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Tabari) (839 - 923) in his book [tafsir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafsir) (or Qur'anic exegesis)
* The authors did not knew Muhammad

&#x200B;

**We know about the traditional Muhammad from two main sources:**

**Source One** [**Sira - Muhammad Prophetic biography**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophetic_biography)

according to which Muhammad was born in 570 and died in 632 (we'll reference the date of his death later on).

This biography was written by [Ibn Hisham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Hisham) who died at 830 (200 years after Muhammad), Ibn Hisham didn't knew Muhammad and relied on text by [Ibn Ishaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Ishaq) of around 767 which we don't have which is also about 100+ years after the death of Muhammad. None of them knew Muhammad personally so those are all second hand accounts.

**Source Two The Hadith (Oral Tradition)**

There's a huge amount of Hadiths (stories about Muhammad) which were written even later (about 250 years after Muhammad's death). They're relaying on a delivery chain ([Isnad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith_studies)) and are very careful about long ones in order to prove that it comes from a reliable source that reaches all the way to Muhammad.

There are main collections:

* [Muhammad al-Bukhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Bukhari) \- 810 - 840Notice the family name which is from Bukhara Uzbekistan.
* [Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_ibn_al-Hajjaj) \- 821 - 875
* [Imam Al-Tirmidhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Tirmidhi) \- 824 -892

&#x200B;

# The Historic Muhammad

The information about historic Muhammad is based on

* [Epigraphic information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigraphy) (the study of inscriptions) in graffiti on rocks some of which weren't deciphered to this day. Some of which are similar to texts from the Quran (and some are not) and it's hard to know who came before (those texts or the text from the Quran).
* Inscriptions on public buildings
* [Papyrological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrology) (the study of manuscripts of ancient literature, correspondence, legal archives, etc) and [numismatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numismatics) (the study of currency) assemblage (a group or a complete system)
* Christian chronicles by Byzantine authors, recent archaeological findings from the days of the conquests.
* These sources are superior to the traditions in the hadith and the Sira, because they are free of anachronisms (an act of attributing a custom, event, or object to a period to which it does not belong) and apologetics (reasoned arguments or writings in justification of something, typically a theory or religious doctrine).

&#x200B;

# Thomas the Presbyter

* [Thomas the Presbyter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Presbyter) was a Syrian priest who lived around 640 in North-East Mesopotamia who wrote a book about the caliphs. This is the first outside of Muslim testimony where Muhmd is mentioned.
* In Feb.634 soldiers under the command of Muhmd fought near Gaza & killed the noble byzantine Bar Yardan
* The conquerors are identified by the name [Tayyiiye/Tayaye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayy)
* They've killed 4,000 Christian, Jews & Samaritans villagers
* After two years they've conquered the entirety of Mesopotamia
* According to this testimony Muhmd isn't a prophet but a warlord
* Muhmd still lived 2 years after the traditional version

&#x200B;

**Battle Description according to Thomas the Presbyter**

[The original description of the battle from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Presbyter) is quoted here. The year is different due to a different calendar used:

>In the year 945, indiction 7, on Friday 4 February at the ninth hour, there was a battle between the Romans and the Tayyaye of Muhmd in Palestine twelve miles east of Gaza. The Romans fled, leaving behind the patrician bryrdn, whom the Arabs killed. Some 4,000 poor villagers of Palestine were killed there, Christians, Jews and Samaritans. The Arabs ravaged the whole region.  
>  
>In the year 947, indiction 9, the Arabs invaded the whole of Syria and went down to Persia and conquered it. The Arabs climbed the mountain of Mardin and killed many monks there in \[the monasteries of\] Qedar and Bnata. There died the blessed man Simon, doorkeeper of Qedar, brother of Thomas the priest.

&#x200B;

Thomas the Presbyter was very close to Muhmd in terms of the date & his location. Muhmd is a Syriac Greek transliteration which was written without vowels like in the biblical text. Also if you'll remember a lot of countries/people have a problem pronouncing a certain vowels in Arabic in the name Muhammad. So a name like Muhammad is changed to various variation like Muhmd, Mahmd etc.

Note that the conquerors are identified by the name [Tayyiiye/Tayaye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayy) and not as Muslims or Arabs. scholar guess that it was a tribe in Arabia.

It took them two years (Note that the Palestine territory historically hosted a range of 150-250k people. So if we assume lots of small villages throughout the Palestine & Syrian region, it was probably an easy conquest for a determined army. Sort of like a storm that no one has predicted and has conquered the area)

&#x200B;

# Muhammad as an international trader

**Three testimonies mention Muhmd as a trader between states**

* [**Jacob of Edessa**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_of_Edessa) ([Urfa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urfa) in Northern Syria 633 - 708) mentions that a man named Muhmd traded in lands in Israel, Phoenician Tyre (Lebanon) and Arabia in Northern Iraq under Byzantine (Christian) control
* [**The Bishop Sebeos**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebeos) (around 645) in his book the Armenian chronical mentioned a trader named Muhmd
* Claimed that the Jews in Israel asked for permissions from the conquerors to build Bet Hammiqdas (Hebrew word for 'temple house') in Jerusalem
* He calls the conquerors as [Agarenoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagarenes) which origins are Hagar or the sons of Ishmael

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* [**Theophilus of Edessa**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophilus_of_Edessa) aka Theophilus ibn Tuma and Thawafil(695 - 785) Historian. In the Chronicle from the year 638 he describes the young Muhmd who left his city [Yathrib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina) (Medina in Saudi Arabia today) and traded in the land of Israel.
* After knowing the place he was charmed from the one God religion and went back to his tribe.
* Later he described Muhmd as a warlord who took part in conquering south greater Syria (which include Israel among others). Muhmd praised the richness of the land of Israel to his troops and claimed that only due to their belief in the one God, God will give them a fertile land. If they listen to his words, Allah (God) will also give them this land. His soldiers encountered no resistance and returned loaded with loot from the plunder.
* Theophilus identify the conquerors as [Tayaye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayy) and Muhmd not as a prophet but as a warlord.

To the south & north of Arabia there were Jewish or Christian kingdoms that replaced hands all the time but the point is is that there was monotheism (believe in one God) which Muhmd came & discovered (unlike what the tradition says that there was anarchy, ignorant etc).

I'm guessing that more the a thousands years ago with the population being a lot smaller in the area (again historically there were anywhere from 150-250k people) and a lot more wildlife and fertile ground, some areas were better then desert like areas in the Gulf States/Africa.

Also note that the conquest was done to gain riches not to bring or preach about a new religion.

&#x200B;

* [**Sophronius**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophronius_of_Jerusalem) (560 - 638) was the Patriarch of Jerusalem ןn his sermon from 635 he reports that [Ishmaelites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmaelites) [Hagraye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagarenes) & [Sarakenoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saracen) are ""parked"" around Jerusalem and out of fear the Christians are avoiding from reaching Bethlehem in Christmas
* He describes the cruelty of the Sarakenoi who destroyed & burned cities & villages, plundered possessions, desecrated churches (this is probably where most of the wealth was), won against the byzantine & murdered them.
* The Sarakenoi according to his sermon are planning to conquer the entire world under the leadership of their commander (meaning that they were afraid of them).
* in 634 Sophronius was forced to sign a peace treaty with the victors who conquered Jerusalem with the help of the Jews

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* Despite Muhammad conquering Jerusalem, the Islamic tradition attributed the conquering of the city & the dome of the rock to the ruler [Umar ibn al-Khattab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar) despite Sophronius's descriptions.
* Despite the tradition establishing the death of Muhammad at 632, it turns out that he was alive during the conquest of Jerusalem in 634.
* Those testimonies are close to the days of conquests, are independent of each other and confirms the testimony that Muhammad participated in the conquest of the land of Israel as a warlord.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* [Doctrina Iacobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_of_Jacob) an apologetic polemic writing (preserved since then) a Christian against a Jew from [Carthage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage) who was present during the occupation of Gaza in 16/7/634.
* Avrams from Caesarea writes his brother Justus that the Sarakenoi killed their byzantine commander to the joy of the Jews.
* He informs him on the appearance of a Sarakenoi prophet that announced on the coming of Christos (Jesus), and that he's holding in his hands the keys to heaven.
* He consulted with one of the elders in the community who enlighted him to the fact that real prophets do not come before the people armed from head to toe.
* This testimony defines Muhammad as a warlord and also ties him to Jesus Christ.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* A Christian-Syrian Chronical from Horistan in 660 mentioned that God sent a lot of Ishmaelites, like sand on a beach, head by Muhmd. Against the [Sasanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire) King's Soldier Yazdegred ([the III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazdegerd_III)?) (Note: not the Byzantine empire, we're on the other eastern side. There are two empires in conflict) no wall or gate could stop them and the conquered the entirety of Persia.
* Jehohanan Bar Pankya (687) a Syria monk describes Muhammad as a cruel ruler that his soldiers were so loyal that they've executed anyone who disobeyed him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* Chronical Zonkanin from Syria in 717 mentions Muhammad not only as a warlord but as a kind and a prophet together.
* The (Arab) soldiers forced the Romens to flee east of the [Euphrates river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphrates) (to Persia). They've conquered & controlled all of the land of Israel.
* Their first king was called Muhmd and he ruled them for 7 years. They called him a prophet because he liberated them from various cults and taught them that there's only one God (we're starting to see the new character that would appear later in the traditional Islam).
* He set rules for them and they've called him God's messanger.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# John of Damascus

&#x200B;

* [John of Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Damascus) (Mansur Ibn Sarjun 676 - 749) was a [Nestorianian priest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestorianism). His testimony is from the end of the rule of caliph [Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Malik_ibn_Marwan) (the fifth Umayyad caliph, ruling April.685 - October.705)
* John served as a senior official in the public administration of the empire and was responsible for financing the conquest campaigns
* In the days of Abd Al-Malik it was decided to start processes that will promote Islamization & Arabization in the administration of the empire at the expense of the Greek & Syria languages.
* The initiative took many years until the population spoke Arabic and embraced Islam.
* John decided not to convert to Islam and in 720 abandoned his post in Damascus (the capitol at the time) and joined the [Mar Saba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_Saba) monastery in the Yehuda desert.
* John researched the various religious movements that deviated from official Christianity and wrote  '*the Heresy of the Ishmaelites'* and '*the Disputation between a Christian and a Saracen'*.

In here we can see how the conquers with an undefined name slowly started getting transitioned into a new religion that will later be called Islam. This started during his period. Egypt was conquered during this period but until the 14th century (1300) was still mostly Christians. An important thing to remember is that just because there's an occupation doesn't mean that everybody has switched or changed their religion. Also of note is that John was a Christian serving in the empire, the scholars argue that most in that time period were Christians.

&#x200B;

* John's views on the new cult in his book Teaching on Islam doesn't mention a book called the Quran yet. (He's an intellectual living in Damascus during the rule of the 6th ruler. After the occupation)
* According to him a new prophet named Muhmd had risen which befriended a monk follower of the Christian theologian Arius of Cyrenaica who all oppose the principle of the Trinity (basically an argument over the father of Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. Is Jesus the son of a God? God himself? or both?). The priest taught Muhammad the bible & the new testament (Christian's holy book) and so he has decided to create a heretic religion of his own (this is how John is seeing & describing things).
* John hints to the existence of the character [Waraqah ibn Nawfal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waraqah_ibn_Nawfal) (610) according to the tradition he was first cousin of Khadijah bint Khuwaylid (Muhammad first wife) who was apparently a Jewish person from the (Nasara or Nazraum) community and also knew the Alhassaim community from the dead sea region, (Christians) who remained faithful to the bible.
* John says that God revealed to this false prophet a heavenly book which writtens (according to John) ridiculas principles. This prophet claimed that there's only one God, maker of all, who was not created, and has not created (supposedly the earth, men, animals etc).
* To us Christians John claims, he calls Mushrikon (sharing/shares), since we say that Christ is the son of God and also a God.
* According to the prophet, Christ is God's spirit but was created. Jesus is the son of Miriam, **Amram's daughter and Aaron's sister** (the same text in the Quran which means that some of the text or stories have already existed but not as a unified book), who wasn't conceived from a man's seaman. God's spirit entered Miriam and she birthed Jesus the prophet and servant of God.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* John's main argument is that the new religion is dissident/heretic cult that remained faithful to Christianity pre-[The First Council of Nicaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea) (325) and mainly to [the First Council of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Constantinople) (381).
* John's convinced that Muhammad's doctrine will remain a marginal phenomenon, like the rest of the cults he wrote about. According to his testimony, it turns out that during the second half of the 8th century (750ad) the Quran is not crystallized.
* His words were written before parts of the Quran were gathered in the codex, and before the hadith compositions by the Islamic theologian from the Khorasan region. John does not mention the words Islam or Muslims, and he calls the conquerors by the name of Ishmaelites.
* John knew the version about the death of Jesus that appears in the Koran and the concept of Shubina Lahum.The concept appears in Sura 4 (The Women) which claims that the Jews did indeed want to crucify Jesus but he was not actually crucified but they only thought that they had crucified him and in fact they crucified only his shadow.(People at the time had issues that Jesus (their prophet) was crucified and killed like any other man so came up with various other reasonings to what ""*really""* happened)
* He saw in Sura 2 al-Baqara (the cow), the longest in the Koran, a separate composition in which the creation of man is told in a version that does not appear in the book of Genesis. According to this version, God demanded the angels to bow down to man, and only Iblis the devil refused to obey and was expelled from heaven.

# Summery & other Scholarly Musings

* The [epigraphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigraphy) (the study of inscriptions) mention of Muhammad appears in 685 on a coin in the city of Bishpur in southeastern Iran, during the reign of [Abdullah ibn Al-Zubayr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_Allah_ibn_al-Zubayr) (624 - 692).
* Two other mentions of Muhammad appear in a collection of graffiti and papyri discovered in the ruins of [Elmird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrcania_(fortress)) in the northwest of the Dead Sea and they date to the beginning of the 8th century.
* Tens of thousands of graffiti inscriptions on rocks along the caravan route between [Tadmur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyra) in Syria and [Najran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najran) in northern Yemen provide us with verses in the Koran that have not yet been definitively formulated. Some preceded its composition and others were engraved in the rock during its formation. Until the year 738, the name of Muhammad and the name of Mecca are absent from them.
* It is possible that the name Muhammad in the inscriptions is nothing more than an adjective and that the name of the hero of Islam was Kutum.
* These facts caused the archaeologist [Yehuda Dayan Nebo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_D._Nevo) to deny the traditional image of Muhammad. He was one of the first to reach the far-reaching conclusion that the Arab Empire preceded the birth of Islam.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* The name Muhammad is given prominence in the monumental inscription inside the Beit al-Maqdash, the Dome of the Rock, in the days of [Abdelmalik Ibn Marwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Malik_ibn_Marwan).
* The caliph [al-Mamun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ma%27mun) (786 - 833) of [the House of Abbas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Abbas) in Baghdad deleted the name of his rival Abdulmalik from the [House of Umayyad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_dynasty) and put his name in the inscription.
* It is also reasonable to assume that he changed parts of the inscription according to the spirit of the times, the worsening of the intra-Christian controversy regarding the theological essence of Jesus and the formation of the Muslim tradition. Actions of this type were acceptable after the civil wars. In the octagonal temple in Jerusalem, Muhammad transforms for the first time from a warlord to a messenger of God.
* This is how it is expressed in the [Shahada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahada) clauses, the tenets of the faith of the new religion. The inscription takes care to emphasize mainly the denial of the divinity of Jesus and the denial of the Trinity. It indicates the beginning of the establishment of a new religion in the Christian-Syrian society in Asia.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* The inscription mentions two messengers of God: Jesus and Muhammad. Muhammad is mentioned six times and Jesus son of Mary five times. Both are defined theologically identically.
* Jesus receives a more developed and prominent rhetorical mention compared to Mahomet, who is mentioned only according to a schematic formula.
* Researchers agree that the letters ""Mahmed"" are not a first name but a nickname.
* Some claim that the nickname refers to Jesus in the inscription and others see this word as a generic name that refers to all rulers.
* According to this the theological formula ""Muhammad the Messenger of God may God bless him"" becomes ""Abd al-Malik the Messenger of God may God bless him"" or ""Al Ma'mun the Messenger of God may God bless him"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* A database of inscriptions on papyrus discovered in Egypt, dated to the year 930, provides us with a clue to the founding event ""Hizra"".
* The refugee Muhammad is persecuted by the members of his family and tribe, flees from the city of Mecca, and is received as a celebrated hero in the city of Yathrib.
* The heroic reception of the persecuted refugee in the partially Jewish city calls into question the existence of the event.
* Archaeologically, there is no proof of the existence of Mecca in Muhammad's time. It is possible that the migration to Madinah (Yithrib) was invented only during the reign of the Umayyad rulers and its date was set to 622.
* According to tradition, Muhammad won the title of prophet only after he received enlightenment, like [Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle), and became God's messenger. The traditions about Muhammad were created far from the Arabian Peninsula, in the regions of Sassanian Persia, by theologians born in the 9th century.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* Was the occupation Muslim?
* Was there an Arab occupation?
* The conquerors were not Muslims, and their enemies did not call them that, because Islam was not yet born, and the Koran was not yet formulated.
* Muhammad fighters called themselves ""Mu'aminun"", believers, and not ""Muslims"". The Byzantine Christians called the conquerors by the names of Tiaya, Mahagraia, Mahgraye or Magaritai which originate from the term Mohajirun, meaning the fighters in the way of God.
* They are also mentioned under the name of the Greim or Agarenoi which originates from Hagar Bat Avraham. Originally the term Mohajirun is not related to Hijra.
* A Syriac text from 682 created an association between two similar-sounding terms Mahgraye and Hagar mother of Ishmael, and both were combined in the term Hijra, the legendary transition from Mecca to Medina. The multitude of names given to the conquerors indicates more than anything else the difference in their origin and the doubt as to whether they originated from Hijaz.

&#x200B;

* Archeology has not revealed clear signs of siege, destruction, burning of cities or mass murder, findings that characterize powerful conquests.
* The conquests were not intended to spread a new religion. Their goal was to control new territories in order to collect taxes, take booty, plunder the soldiers' economy and recruit forced laborers.
* Muhammad's part in the conquests in the Syria-Land of Israel region raises the question of whether the authors of the Al-Sirah and the Hadith knew details about the conquests and Muhammad's participation in them.
* It is likely that if they knew about all of this they would not refrain from praising their hero for the conquest of the holy city of Jerusalem and his contribution to the foundation of the empire.

While it appears that the Israeli/Palestinian conflict isn't about religion, Palestinian extremists often quote and use religious extremism as reasoning both to fight (resist), remove the fear of death and de-humanize the enemy.

While there are around \~2 billion of peaceful Muslims, the Islamic religion reputation suffers from the extremists few (the Islamists or fundamentalists).

Examples of religious extremism:

# Foreword

[We've had a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/q3g13q/through_arab_eyes_06_is_jerusalem_really_a_holy/) about the traditional Muhammad's history. This post is about the historic Muhammad.

The historic Muhammad is different from the traditional Muhammad and we'll go over the research findings of the historic Muhammad. About 200-250 years separate between the two characters & testimonies.

**How do we know about the historic Muhammad?**

There have been testimonies written during his life time by non-Muslims (mostly Christians) and non-Arabs at the time and therefor are more objective then the traditional one.

# The Traditional Muhammad

* [Sira - Muhammad Prophetic biography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophetic_biography) 570 - 632  

   * [Ibn Hisham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Hisham) \- Died at 830
   * [Ibn Ishaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Ishaq) \- Around 767
* Hadith - Islam oral tradition. A series of documents connected by a delivery chain ([Isnad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith_studies)) that ties them to Muhammad.  

   * 1.5 Million Hadiths but 3 main collections
   * [Muhammad al-Bukhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Bukhari) \- 810 - 840
   * [Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_ibn_al-Hajjaj) \- 821 - 875
   * [Imam Al-Tirmidhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Tirmidhi) \- 824 -892
* lived about 200 years after the death of Muhammad, they originate from the [Zoroastrianism Paras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism) far from the [Hejaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz) / [Hejaz Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hejaz) in Arabia
* The Islamic traditions ([Sunnah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnah)) where concentrated by the historian [Muhammad Al-Tabari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Tabari) (839 - 923) in his book [tafsir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafsir) (or Qur'anic exegesis)
* The authors did not knew Muhammad

**We know about the traditional Muhammad from two main sources:**

**Source One** [**Sira - Muhammad Prophetic biography**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophetic_biography)

according to which Muhammad was born in 570 and died in 632 (we'll reference the date of his death later on).

This biography was written by [Ibn Hisham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Hisham) who died at 830 (200 years after Muhammad), Ibn Hisham didn't knew Muhammad and relied on text by [Ibn Ishaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Ishaq) of around 767 which we don't have which is also about 100+ years after the death of Muhammad. None of them knew Muhammad personally so those are all second hand accounts.

**Source Two The Hadith (Oral Tradition)**

There's a huge amount of Hadiths (stories about Muhammad) which were written even later (about 250 years after Muhammad's death). They're relaying on a delivery chain ([Isnad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith_studies)) and are very careful about long ones in order to prove that it comes from a reliable source that reaches all the way to Muhammad.

There are main collections:

* [Muhammad al-Bukhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Bukhari) \- 810 - 840Notice the family name which is from Bukhara Uzbekistan.
* [Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_ibn_al-Hajjaj) \- 821 - 875
* [Imam Al-Tirmidhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Tirmidhi) \- 824 -892

# The Historic Muhammad

The information about historic Muhammad is based on

* [Epigraphic information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigraphy) (the study of inscriptions) in graffiti on rocks some of which weren't deciphered to this day. Some of which are similar to texts from the Quran (and some are not) and it's hard to know who came before (those texts or the text from the Quran).
* Inscriptions on public buildings
* [Papyrological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrology) (the study of manuscripts of ancient literature, correspondence, legal archives, etc) and [numismatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numismatics) (the study of currency) assemblage (a group or a complete system)
* Christian chronicles by Byzantine authors, recent archaeological findings from the days of the conquests.
* These sources are superior to the traditions in the hadith and the Sira, because they are free of anachronisms (an act of attributing a custom, event, or object to a period to which it does not belong) and apologetics (reasoned arguments or writings in justification of something, typically a theory or religious doctrine).

# Thomas the Presbyter

* [Thomas the Presbyter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Presbyter) was a Syrian priest who lived around 640 in North-East Mesopotamia who wrote a book about the caliphs. This is the first outside of Muslim testimony where Muhmd is mentioned.
* In Feb.634 soldiers under the command of Muhmd fought near Gaza & killed the noble byzantine Bar Yardan
* The conquerors are identified by the name [Tayyiiye/Tayaye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayy)
* They've killed 4,000 Christian, Jews & Samaritans villagers
* After two years they've conquered the entirety of Mesopotamia
* According to this testimony Muhmd isn't a prophet but a warlord
* Muhmd still lived 2 years after the traditional version

**Battle Description according to Thomas the Presbyter**

[The original description of the battle from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Presbyter) is quoted here. The year is different due to a different calendar used:

>In the year 945, indiction 7, on Friday 4 February at the ninth hour, there was a battle between the Romans and the Tayyaye of Muhmd in Palestine twelve miles east of Gaza. The Romans fled, leaving behind the patrician bryrdn, whom the Arabs killed. Some 4,000 poor villagers of Palestine were killed there, Christians, Jews and Samaritans. The Arabs ravaged the whole region.  
>  
>  
In the year 947, indiction 9, the Arabs invaded the whole of Syria and went down to Persia and conquered it. The Arabs climbed the mountain of Mardin and killed many monks there in \[the monasteries of\] Qedar and Bnata. There died the blessed man Simon, doorkeeper of Qedar, brother of Thomas the priest.

Thomas the Presbyter was very close to Muhmd in terms of the date & his location. Muhmd is a Syriac Greek transliteration which was written without vowels like in the biblical text. Also if you'll remember a lot of countries/people have a problem pronouncing a certain vowels in Arabic in the name Muhammad. So a name like Muhammad is changed to various variation like Muhmd, Mahmd etc.

Note that the conquerors are identified by the name [Tayyiiye/Tayaye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayy) and not as Muslims or Arabs. scholar guess that it was a tribe in Arabia.

It took them two years (Note that the Palestine territory historically hosted a range of 150-250k people. So if we assume lots of small villages throughout the Palestine & Syrian region, it was probably an easy conquest for a determined army. Sort of like a storm that no one has predicted and has conquered the area)

# Muhammad as an international trader

**Three testimonies mention Muhmd as a trader between states**

* [**Jacob of Edessa**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_of_Edessa) ([Urfa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urfa) in Northern Syria 633 - 708) mentions that a man named Muhmd traded in lands in Israel, Phoenician Tyre (Lebanon) and Arabia in Northern Iraq under Byzantine (Christian) control
* [**The Bishop Sebeos**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebeos) (around 645) in his book the Armenian chronical mentioned a trader named Muhmd
* Claimed that the Jews in Israel asked for permissions from the conquerors to build Bet Hammiqdas (Hebrew word for 'temple house') in Jerusalem
* He calls the conquerors as [Agarenoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagarenes) which origins are Hagar or the sons of Ishmael

&#x200B;

* [**Theophilus of Edessa**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophilus_of_Edessa) aka Theophilus ibn Tuma and Thawafil(695 - 785) Historian. In the Chronicle from the year 638 he describes the young Muhmd who left his city [Yathrib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina) (Medina in Saudi Arabia today) and traded in the land of Israel.
* After knowing the place he was charmed from the one God religion and went back to his tribe.
* Later he described Muhmd as a warlord who took part in conquering south greater Syria (which include Israel among others). Muhmd praised the richness of the land of Israel to his troops and claimed that only due to their belief in the one God, God will give them a fertile land. If they listen to his words, Allah (God) will also give them this land. His soldiers encountered no resistance and returned loaded with loot from the plunder.
* Theophilus identify the conquerors as [Tayaye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayy) and Muhmd not as a prophet but as a warlord.

To the south & north of Arabia there were Jewish or Christian kingdoms that replaced hands all the time but the point is is that there was monotheism (believe in one God) which Muhmd came & discovered (unlike what the tradition says that there was anarchy, ignorant etc).

I'm guessing that more the a thousands years ago with the population being a lot smaller in the area (again historically there were anywhere from 150-250k people) and a lot more wildlife and fertile ground, some areas were better then desert like areas in the Gulf States/Africa.

Also note that the conquest was done to gain riches not to bring or preach about a new religion.

&#x200B;

* [**Sophronius**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophronius_of_Jerusalem) (560 - 638) was the Patriarch of Jerusalem ןn his sermon from 635 he reports that [Ishmaelites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmaelites) [Hagraye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagarenes) & [Sarakenoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saracen) are ""parked"" around Jerusalem and out of fear the Christians are avoiding from reaching Bethlehem in Christmas
* He describes the cruelty of the Sarakenoi who destroyed & burned cities & villages, plundered possessions, desecrated churches (this is probably where most of the wealth was), won against the byzantine & murdered them.
* The Sarakenoi according to his sermon are planning to conquer the entire world under the leadership of their commander (meaning that they were afraid of them).
* in 634 Sophronius was forced to sign a peace treaty with the victors who conquered Jerusalem with the help of the Jews

&#x200B;

* Despite Muhammad conquering Jerusalem, the Islamic tradition attributed the conquering of the city & the dome of the rock to the ruler [Umar ibn al-Khattab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar) despite Sophronius's descriptions.
* Despite the tradition establishing the death of Muhammad at 632, it turns out that he was alive during the conquest of Jerusalem in 634.
* Those testimonies are close to the days of conquests, are independent of each other and confirms the testimony that Muhammad participated in the conquest of the land of Israel as a warlord.

&#x200B;

* [Doctrina Iacobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_of_Jacob) an apologetic polemic writing (preserved since then) a Christian against a Jew from [Carthage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage) who was present during the occupation of Gaza in 16/7/634.
* Avrams from Caesarea writes his brother Justus that the Sarakenoi killed their byzantine commander to the joy of the Jews.
* He informs him on the appearance of a Sarakenoi prophet that announced on the coming of Christos (Jesus), and that he's holding in his hands the keys to heaven.
* He consulted with one of the elders in the community who enlighted him to the fact that real prophets do not come before the people armed from head to toe.
* This testimony defines Muhammad as a warlord and also ties him to Jesus Christ.

&#x200B;

* A Christian-Syrian Chronical from Horistan in 660 mentioned that God sent a lot of Ishmaelites, like sand on a beach, head by Muhmd. Against the [Sasanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire) King's Soldier Yazdegred ([the III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazdegerd_III)?) (Note: not the Byzantine empire, we're on the other eastern side. There are two empires in conflict) no wall or gate could stop them and the conquered the entirety of Persia.
* Jehohanan Bar Pankya (687) a Syria monk describes Muhammad as a cruel ruler that his soldiers were so loyal that they've executed anyone who disobeyed him.

&#x200B;

* Chronical Zonkanin from Syria in 717 mentions Muhammad not only as a warlord but as a kind and a prophet together.
* The (Arab) soldiers forced the Romens to flee east of the [Euphrates river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphrates) (to Persia). They've conquered & controlled all of the land of Israel.
* Their first king was called Muhmd and he ruled them for 7 years. They called him a prophet because he liberated them from various cults and taught them that there's only one God (we're starting to see the new character that would appear later in the traditional Islam).
* He set rules for them and they've called him God's messanger.

# John of Damascus

* [John of Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Damascus) (Mansur Ibn Sarjun 676 - 749) was a [Nestorianian priest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestorianism). His testimony is from the end of the rule of caliph [Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Malik_ibn_Marwan) (the fifth Umayyad caliph, ruling April.685 - October.705)
* John served as a senior official in the public administration of the empire and was responsible for financing the conquest campaigns
* In the days of Abd Al-Malik it was decided to start processes that will promote Islamization & Arabization in the administration of the empire at the expense of the Greek & Syria languages.
* The initiative took many years until the population spoke Arabic and embraced Islam.
* John decided not to convert to Islam and in 720 abandoned his post in Damascus (the capitol at the time) and joined the [Mar Saba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_Saba) monastery in the Yehuda desert.
* John researched the various religious movements that deviated from official Christianity and wrote '*the Heresy of the Ishmaelites'* and '*the Disputation between a Christian and a Saracen'*.

In here we can see how the conquers with an undefined name slowly started getting transitioned into a new religion that will later be called Islam. This started during his period. Egypt was conquered during this period but until the 14th century (1300) was still mostly Christians. An important thing to remember is that just because there's an occupation doesn't mean that everybody has switched or changed their religion. Also of note is that John was a Christian serving in the empire, the scholars argue that most in that time period were Christians.

&#x200B;

* John's views on the new cult in his book Teaching on Islam doesn't mention a book called the Quran yet. (He's an intellectual living in Damascus during the rule of the 6th ruler. After the occupation)
* According to him a new prophet named Muhmd had risen which befriended a monk follower of the Christian theologian Arius of Cyrenaica who all oppose the principle of the Trinity (basically an argument over the father of Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. Is Jesus the son of a God? God himself? or both?). The priest taught Muhammad the bible & the new testament (Christian's holy book) and so he has decided to create a heretic religion of his own (this is how John is seeing & describing things).
* John hints to the existence of the character [Waraqah ibn Nawfal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waraqah_ibn_Nawfal) (610) according to the tradition he was first cousin of Khadijah bint Khuwaylid (Muhammad first wife) who was apparently a Jewish person from the (Nasara or Nazraum) community and also knew the Alhassaim community from the dead sea region, (Christians) who remained faithful to the bible.
* John says that God revealed to this false prophet a heavenly book which writtens (according to John) ridiculas principles. This prophet claimed that there's only one God, maker of all, who was not created, and has not created (supposedly the earth, men, animals etc).
* To us Christians John claims, he calls Mushrikon (sharing/shares), since we say that Christ is the son of God and also a God.
* According to the prophet, Christ is God's spirit but was created. Jesus is the son of Miriam, **Amram's daughter and Aaron's sister** (the same text in the Quran which means that some of the text or stories have already existed but not as a unified book), who wasn't conceived from a man's seaman. God's spirit entered Miriam and she birthed Jesus the prophet and servant of God.

* John's main argument is that the new religion is dissident/heretic cult that remained faithful to Christianity pre-[The First Council of Nicaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea) (325) and mainly to [the First Council of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Constantinople) (381).
* John's convinced that Muhammad's doctrine will remain a marginal phenomenon, like the rest of the cults he wrote about. According to his testimony, it turns out that during the second half of the 8th century (750ad) the Quran is not crystallized.
* His words were written before parts of the Quran were gathered in the codex, and before the hadith compositions by the Islamic theologian from the Khorasan region. John does not mention the words Islam or Muslims, and he calls the conquerors by the name of Ishmaelites.
* John knew the version about the death of Jesus that appears in the Koran and the concept of Shubina Lahum.The concept appears in Sura 4 (The Women) which claims that the Jews did indeed want to crucify Jesus but he was not actually crucified but they only thought that they had crucified him and in fact they crucified only his shadow.(People at the time had issues that Jesus (their prophet) was crucified and killed like any other man so came up with various other reasonings to what ""*really""* happened)
* He saw in Sura 2 al-Baqara (the cow), the longest in the Koran, a separate composition in which the creation of man is told in a version that does not appear in the book of Genesis. According to this version, God demanded the angels to bow down to man, and only Iblis the devil refused to obey and was expelled from heaven.

# Summery & other Scholarly Musings

* The [epigraphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigraphy) (the study of inscriptions) mention of Muhammad appears in 685 on a coin in the city of Bishpur in southeastern Iran, during the reign of [Abdullah ibn Al-Zubayr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_Allah_ibn_al-Zubayr) (624 - 692).
* Two other mentions of Muhammad appear in a collection of graffiti and papyri discovered in the ruins of [Elmird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrcania_(fortress)) in the northwest of the Dead Sea and they date to the beginning of the 8th century.
* Tens of thousands of graffiti inscriptions on rocks along the caravan route between [Tadmur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyra) in Syria and [Najran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najran) in northern Yemen provide us with verses in the Koran that have not yet been definitively formulated. Some preceded its composition and others were engraved in the rock during its formation. Until the year 738, the name of Muhammad and the name of Mecca are absent from them.
* It is possible that the name Muhammad in the inscriptions is nothing more than an adjective and that the name of the hero of Islam was Kutum.
* These facts caused the archaeologist [Yehuda Dayan Nebo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_D._Nevo) to deny the traditional image of Muhammad. He was one of the first to reach the far-reaching conclusion that the Arab Empire preceded the birth of Islam.

&#x200B;

* The name Muhammad is given prominence in the monumental inscription inside the Beit al-Maqdash, the Dome of the Rock, in the days of [Abdelmalik Ibn Marwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Malik_ibn_Marwan).
* The caliph [al-Mamun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ma%27mun) (786 - 833) of [the House of Abbas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Abbas) in Baghdad deleted the name of his rival Abdulmalik from the [House of Umayyad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_dynasty) and put his name in the inscription.
* It is also reasonable to assume that he changed parts of the inscription according to the spirit of the times, the worsening of the intra-Christian controversy regarding the theological essence of Jesus and the formation of the Muslim tradition. Actions of this type were acceptable after the civil wars. In the octagonal temple in Jerusalem, Muhammad transforms for the first time from a warlord to a messenger of God.
* This is how it is expressed in the [Shahada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahada) clauses, the tenets of the faith of the new religion. The inscription takes care to emphasize mainly the denial of the divinity of Jesus and the denial of the Trinity. It indicates the beginning of the establishment of a new religion in the Christian-Syrian society in Asia.

&#x200B;

* The inscription mentions two messengers of God: Jesus and Muhammad. Muhammad is mentioned six times and Jesus son of Mary five times. Both are defined theologically identically.
* Jesus receives a more developed and prominent rhetorical mention compared to Mahomet, who is mentioned only according to a schematic formula.
* Researchers agree that the letters ""Mahmed"" are not a first name but a nickname.
* Some claim that the nickname refers to Jesus in the inscription and others see this word as a generic name that refers to all rulers.
* According to this the theological formula ""Muhammad the Messenger of God may God bless him"" becomes ""Abd al-Malik the Messenger of God may God bless him"" or ""Al Ma'mun the Messenger of God may God bless him"".

&#x200B;

* A database of inscriptions on papyrus discovered in Egypt, dated to the year 930, provides us with a clue to the founding event ""Hizra"".
* The refugee Muhammad is persecuted by the members of his family and tribe, flees from the city of Mecca, and is received as a celebrated hero in the city of Yathrib.
* The heroic reception of the persecuted refugee in the partially Jewish city calls into question the existence of the event.
* Archaeologically, there is no proof of the existence of Mecca in Muhammad's time. It is possible that the migration to Madinah (Yithrib) was invented only during the reign of the Umayyad rulers and its date was set to 622.
* According to tradition, Muhammad won the title of prophet only after he received enlightenment, like [Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle), and became God's messenger. The traditions about Muhammad were created far from the Arabian Peninsula, in the regions of Sassanian Persia, by theologians born in the 9th century.

&#x200B;

* Was the occupation Muslim?
* Was there an Arab occupation?
* The conquerors were not Muslims, and their enemies did not call them that, because Islam was not yet born, and the Koran was not yet formulated.
* Muhammad fighters called themselves ""Mu'aminun"", believers, and not ""Muslims"". The Byzantine Christians called the conquerors by the names of Tiaya, Mahagraia, Mahgraye or Magaritai which originate from the term Mohajirun, meaning the fighters in the way of God.
* They are also mentioned under the name of the Greim or Agarenoi which originates from Hagar Bat Avraham. Originally the term Mohajirun is not related to Hijra.
* A Syriac text from 682 created an association between two similar-sounding terms Mahgraye and Hagar mother of Ishmael, and both were combined in the term Hijra, the legendary transition from Mecca to Medina. The multitude of names given to the conquerors indicates more than anything else the difference in their origin and the doubt as to whether they originated from Hijaz.

&#x200B;

* Archeology has not revealed clear signs of siege, destruction, burning of cities or mass murder, findings that characterize powerful conquests.
* The conquests were not intended to spread a new religion. Their goal was to control new territories in order to collect taxes, take booty, plunder the soldiers' economy and recruit forced laborers.
* Muhammad's part in the conquests in the Syria-Land of Israel region raises the question of whether the authors of the Al-Sirah and the Hadith knew details about the conquests and Muhammad's participation in them.
* It is likely that if they knew about all of this they would not refrain from praising their hero for the conquest of the holy city of Jerusalem and his contribution to the foundation of the empire.

I stumbled across a website stating how many economical companies or organizations were ""in a way controlled by jewish people"". 
They listed up numerous personalities i also heard of, such as anthony blinken or other heads of pharma industries and stated that they all were jewish.
At first I didnt believe it but after researching it on Google it turned out that every person listed in that website indeed was of jewish heritage.
I also stumbled across an US-american statistic showing that jews are generally more on the wealthier half in comparison with other US-residents. 
Regarding the first website about the jewish personalities I wanted to ask why there are many jewish people on such high positions, considering how small the total jewish population is. Is it true that it's disproportionate and if so, what are the reasons?
I am asking myself the same thing about the statistic on jews being generally wealthier. Is there a historical context? 
Whenever I look up those questions I always either see extreme right wingers talking about the illuminati or i see anti semitism prevention programs which didnt answer my questions either.
So i am inviting everyone with a bit more knowledge to answer this question properly."

Since becoming an adult, I’ve been on a not very consistent journey to learn more about Judaism and become involved in the community, but circumstances (COVID and rural living) have made it difficult. 

I had a goal of officially converting before I had kids. I really wanted to be able to give them access to the culture, community, and religion so they wouldn’t feel that void I felt and feel. Ultimately, it didn’t happen. But my baby arrived a little less than a month ago and I am determined to try to give him something. I found out there will be a Rosh Hashanah festival in the nearest town, so despite my anxieties about my own inadequacy, we are making the three hour trip to attend.

And he was pulled away by his family, I guess they were in a rush, so I didn't get an explanation. The minhag I follow is Sephardi 7-8-11-13 thick on my tallit gadol, but I was always under the impression that it's a personal matter of choice when it comes to the thickness on the tallit katan.

it got me thinking - if there is already a rift between the orthodox community and black people, what do they think of black hebrew israelites, some of whom have been practicing in major foot traffic areas for decades? the wikipedia page says that in israel, despite a rocky start because of perceived antisemitism, the communities have grown together because of how long the BHI have been in the country (roughly the 40s). but what about here, where the orthodox community has, in many ways (particularly schooling, which they cited in israel as a large reason for the integration of the BHI community), cut themselves off from the rest of the city?

First up is the fact he is a Jew. He is an Orphan so technically we don't know for sure who his mother is but the woman universally agreed to be his mother is Jewish. I don't think I need to tell you that Jewish identity is inherited through the mother.

Second is that he is not Jewish in Faith. He is an Orthodox Christian however he was an Atheist all throughout the USSR and it is pretty obvious he doesn't care about and maybe even hates Orthodox Christians.

Third is his hate speech laws have protected a lot of Jewish people and reduced anti Semitism in Russia. To be fair these laws punish mockery of all religious people including Christians and Muslims but still better then nothing."

We (my wife and I) are planning to move back to Israel with our 2 children, after having lived about 5 years overseas. We're really hoping we can live in Tel Aviv (renting), being aware that the price can be a huge challenge. We're in early stages of research trying to get an idea of what would be the total cost of living based on different possible areas. Trying to include a few backup cities (near Tel Aviv) in our research. Also trying to find out about schools/daycares for our children.

At the moment we're trying to browse through Yad2 and try slowly get a picture of the approx. rent prices in different neighbourhoods, while also chatting to some friends and family in Israel for general questions.

Has anyone here done something similar? Any good tips for how to even begin researching this project?

I'm just wondering how this would work in a society where everyone was following the religion to the same degree. It seems like this lifestyle is only feasible when the secular population outnumbers the Ultra-Orthodox and ""keeps them afloat"" so to speak. Surely Jewish men were out working like normal citizens in the Biblical days. Somebody had to be responsible for farming, military service and other forms of hard labor and I don't think it was women"

I’m 38 weeks pregnant and live in Tel Aviv with my husband. We will go to Ichilov and then we have two nights at Lis. I’m just looking for experiences from those who have given birth there before. Especially for those who might not be native Hebrew speakers (I am not a native speaker but my husband is). 

We have not taken a doula and I’m hoping that wasn’t a choice I will live to regret. This is our first child and so we’re getting quite nervous. My OB, who I love, works at Ichilov although I’m sure he’ll have nothing to do with my delivery. 

I’m also curious, with a routine birth, if everything goes smoothly, how long do they keep you in hospital? I’ve read different things in different countries ranging from 24 hours to 4 days. Again, assuming there are no complications. 

Also, any experiences with Lis would be appreciated. We weren’t sure how necessary it was but since we are first time parents, we thought we might as well.

I'm trying to figure out what and how much to tell her. It's a heavy topic and she's still trying to make sense of everything else in the world, so I'm a bit cautious and wary of accidentally triggering an emotional overload (which I've seen with her and I want to avoid happening again)

This is the first time I've really had to discuss this with somebody her age, so anyone with experience or other advice on how to break down the subject in a digestible but not too watered-down manner would be super helpful

The reason I am asking you all for insight is because I wrote this based off Ecclesiastes, which is obviously from the Tanakh. Also if you could correct my view at all id appreciate it. Thanks! 


 I often find myself in a room of smoke and mirrors when I think I've found happiness through the things of this world. This is an exhausting cycle that I'll say I've been in for most of my life. Chasing highs, oh my! Why keep playing the fool when I could, for once, act as the puppeteer and end my life... If the devil's in the details then perhaps my attachment to the details, the ""things of life"", is what is driving this madness. Would I actually obtain happiness if I found pleasure and contentment not in the details, but in the vastness of God's creation? Not only that, but I may be able to obtain contentment by admitting my ignorance of such a creation. I don't know. What I do know is that my idea of happiness is toxic, and that there is something of value in humility that I have yet to learn. Ecclesiastes 7:3-8 teaches me this. 
""Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity. Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart. Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit."""

I am a fairly smart guy and can usually see the reason behind a pattern. However there are a few patterns that I find simply bizarre and one of them involves the chosen people.

Can anyone tell me why Hebrews are so adverse to the idea that a group of Jewish people run Hollywood? Celebrities who mention this are often black listed and labeled as antisemite, despite everyone being aware that it is mostly true. 

Heres my best guess as to why it’s like this. Maybe back in the day, this was a well kept secret and Jews being the traditional people that they are, have a history of never letting us Goys know. Maybe they thought if we knew we’d stop buying tickets. Or force them out of power.  But with the internet, this approach is hopelessly outdated. 

The other problem with the way Hollywood has always handled this is that it actually makes them look like they are trying to cover up some nefarious scheme. It’d be better if they’d just laugh along with the rest of us and say “yeah we own it, now shut up and buy your Barbie ticket.”

So again, I mean no disrespect but I REALlY want to know why this is such a taboo topic and why people using their brain to notice the obvious… why is this such a problem? Can anyone shed some light on it?"

It allows to get around the bad points of a two state solution and take the good points of a two state solution.

I think it could work where israel controls its borders minus east jerusalem internally but maintain military control of all the land, the palestinian side controls west bank plus gaza and everyone votes where they arab or jewish. There would be freedom of movement and the palestinian side would not have a military in the beginning but would control internal security, all the idf could do is stop terrorism if it is an issue but that’s it. 

From there the palestinian side controls east jerusalem but jews can pray on the temple mount and an agreement for immigration. Each side votes for representatives in their parts and an X amount from both sides go to the government that way demographics don’t matter, you vote where your family is born. 

This is a pipe dream solution but so is a two state or a one state solution."

>***Rabbeinu Bahya Vayikra 17:7:2***

These “demons” were primarily composed of only 2 of the 4 elements which man is made of, i.e. of ***fire and air (spirit***). Seeing that they are also light in weight they can fly all over at will. At the time of their creation they were composed of only two elements instead of the four elements which human beings, animals, as well as the plants have in common. As a result, instead of possessing solid bodies such as human beings and animals which therefore are tangible and easily recognizable, these demons are of such transparent shape that they cannot be easily seen and identified. However, they are able to assume a visible form when they so desire by “dressing up” as if they were humans or animals. Their “bodies” are essentially spiritual in nature The creatures composed of four elements are germane to their environment being a composition of the elements in which they exist, i.e. earth, and they fall sick when the correct balance of their four elements is disturbed so that they die as a result and the respective elements disintegrate each to merge again with its constituent part. These demons experience a similar fate when there is an imbalance in the two elements they consist of.  
This is what our sages (Chagigah 16) meant when they said that we have been told of six features possessed by these demons to help us identify them. In three respects they are like human beings

I've always seen Islam to be the religion that is closest to Judaism, I mean we worship the same God, One God, and some Jewish scholars are even of the opinion that God sent Islam to the gentiles, and if you think about it, there's no other religion like Judaism where its adherents literally throw up at Shituf/shirk. We abhore it! While other Jewish scholars say that we aren't polytheists, but we are heretics (that eventually will be granted paradise because of our monotheism). Knowing all of this, why are Jews and Muslims so hostile towards each other? Why is a Jew always siding with a polytheist christian rather than a Muslim? (we both deem them to be polytheists, so no pun intended, it's just facts). Why is it like this? Why can't we live next to each other like neighbors and have the manners of Moses, Abraham, and the rest of the prophets? As a Muslim, I would never give Muhammad precedence over Moses... what's going on here guys? I understand that terrorists is what you're going to tell me is the problem, but I think they're like that because they're occupied.

I am planning to travel withing the next 3 months with my fiance (American tourists) to several countries. 

It all started with the mission to visit one of the 7 Wonders of The World in Petra, Jordan. She suggested we could also visit Israel (Tel Aviv) & the international city of Jerusalem. I insisted to her and made it a priority that if we go to Israel, we MUST visit Palestine and go to Bethlehem.  So as outsiders, how is it for tourists there? How would we be recived? How difficult is it crossing boarders? How long should I stay in Bethlehem? 

Another question, I buy small flags from whatever country I visit. Whether it be Mexico, Colombia, China, Taiwan, etc. It's a must for me. Now, would I be able to purchase flags from Jordan, Palestine, and Israel and not have any problems at boarder crossings? The reason I ask is because someone told me ""that isn't a very smart idea"". I was felt deflated by this but I rather ask you guys instead for answers. I really hope I can continue my collection. 

Thank you all in advance for your time and  responses."

1,2023-08-21,Israelis: Why are there still so many maps that depict Gaza as a part of Israel?,u/RevengeForZach,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/15xn4xd/israelis_why_are_there_still_so_many_maps_that/,"During my time in Israel, I have seen many Israeli maps that include mainland Israel, the West Bank, Golan, and Gaza as one singular territory. And while it is understandable for the West Bank and Golan to be marked as Israeli territory, I struggle to understand why Gaza is as well, since it has lacked any Israeli presence since 2005.

**Is it for ideological reasons?** I understand that most Israelis today consider the withdrawal from Gaza as a huge mistake and should've never happened- and this event is used by those same Israelis as to explain to pro-Palestinians why a withdrawal from the West Bank is simply not viable and will not lead to peace. Wouldn't continuing to label Gaza as a part of Israel undermine this whole argument? Wouldn't it make those same pro-Palestinians respond with, ""But you don't truly care for any form of Palestinian sovereignty, as you refuse to even recognize Gaza as independent on your maps""?

**Is it out of laziness?** It's possible that many of these maps have been on display since before 2005 and no one has considered to change them. But even for maps published after the disengagement, many still display Gaza as just as Israeli as the West Bank. Is it because Israelis are so used to pre-2005 maps that include Gaza that no one cares enough to actually publish maps that display Gaza as independent? And when Israelis see such maps, they think ""Yeah, it's inaccurate. But everyone knows it's inaccurate, so who cares enough to change it?""

**Is it for tourism?** This one may sound silly, but from what I've noticed, maps that label Gaza as a part of Israel are most prevalent on trinkets for tourists (shirts, mugs, keychains, etc). Lots of tourists to Israel tend to be Jewish Zionist westerners who may not be too familiar with the historical context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. So I imagine that Israeli store owners intentionally put these maps on their items so these tourists think ""Yes, Gaza is a part of Israel!"", fuels their uninformed, Zionist thinking, and inclines them to buy these souvenirs.

Or is it because of another reason that I didn't come up with? I'd love to hear answers from anybody, but mainly from Israelis. "

The people were exiled and massacred in 1947. Homes and houses of worship were burned to the ground after being looted.  Many women were raped.

Surviving residents used to stand on the hills of Jerusalem, look down at their former land and pray to return to their communities in the West Bank.

He wasn’t a good person and he has never really owned up to his mistakes and the things he’s done to me and my siblings, so when I moved out I decided no contact was best and it went on like that for a few years.

A couple years ago, my mother passed away. I wasn’t terribly close to her, but no one could afford to handle her funeral rites except for me so out of a sense of duty, I went back home to handle everything. She was the reason I decided to have a sit down meeting with my father.

We talked alot. The main takeaway was that I told him for my mothers sake, I will “wipe the slate clean”. I would let the past go, and only judge his actions from this point on. He seemed to accept this.

During our conversations, he mentioned how his biggest fear was my siblings and I turning completely away from G-D, and although I’m not terribly religious, I do observe some mitzvot. I wear yarmulke, I keep Shabbos, I practice the holidays and attend a Reform shul. He mentioned how proud he was that I became a better man than he was and how I didn’t let the past affect that aspect of myself. 

The service went well, I handled everything, and since then, although I still have negative feelings toward my father, he’s getting older and I have started calling him a few times a week. I’ve let alot go, and I have accepted what I can’t change. 

Our relationship started to build up a bit, starting off from my observance as a talking point. Since then he’s also been working on his observance of the mitzvot. He’s started to get better, not much but a little bit.

I owe alot of this to my goal of being a better Jew and leaving the world and the people around me better than they were before.


Tl;dr: me and my father found common ground in my judaism as a start to better a broken relationship"

Usually I’m quite mindful of what I’m saying, but when I’m angry I don’t even think before saying His name in vain. For example, I have misophonia and last night when my sister started making annoying noises I went “oh G-d” only to immediately realize afterwards, and at the beginning of my teshuvah I had just finished reflecting on why I do this and then I went onto Duolingo to practice Hebrew, and when I lost a heart for making a minor mistake I went “G-D DAMMIT!” I immediately cringe whenever I do it. I have alternate phrases; gosh dang it, oh jeez, oh my goodness, etc. But I can never remember to think before speaking when I’m angry, even though I try really hard to find ways to. I was told opening up about my problem could help, which is why I’m posting this. I hate that I can’t complete this step already because I’m such a creature of habit.

We are curious to know if the sunflower lanyard to represent invisible disabilities or if the puzzle piece lanyard is recognized in Israel (not necessarily by law but just by Israelis in general). 

I always wear this because I am very visibly autistic, I stim a lot (I flap my hands, walk in circles etc) and I communicate mostly through a device and a lot of people can think something is wrong or that I am on drugs. Also if I get lost and need someone to call my parents if anything happens and I need someone to do it for me because this is overwhelming for me so I need to have this lanyard with my information for safety.

My parents and I wonder if it would be better to have a lanyard personalized with the word autism in hebrew or if the sunflower or puzzle piece would work well. Thank you guys.

But at the same time, every day I am being bombarded with ads about courses, saleres, and ever growing demand for high tech workers Wich may or may not be true, Wich makes CS seem like the only good option. 

What are your thoughts on this matter? Do you thinks it's worth it?"

Just curious, what is your opinion on this? Happened a few weeks ago.

Do you think they should be eligible for the law of return?

Do you think the individuals who are not citizens should be allowed to remain?

Other thoughts?

Just curious!

From what I’ve heard many of them came to Israel claiming the law of return, then promised conversion, then never did."

I'm an amateur singer/guitar player in his early 20's moving to Tel Aviv for unrelated work shortly. I already spend all my free time playing, and I'd love to do it in front of people. Not looking to become a rock star, not even necessarily getting paid, but I just want to share my love for music with beer drinking cool people in TLV/YLM. I've got several cover sets prepared and rehearsed, and also a few songs I've written myself. Been playing in several bands earlier, so I know how to behave on a scene. Even if I'm met with ""Israeli honesty"". ;)

So my question is – do you guys know any venues that would host people like me? Of course, I'll walk around with my guitar asking the venues in person – just wondering if you know where to start! If you personally know someone, I'll gladly send you a few recordings!

Take care!

One of the points was to learn holiday greetings, and that they each have their own. 

I’m not sure if this means learn the difference between happy/merry (as in the way that happy birthday and merry Christmas are two different holiday greetings), or if it means to learn the Hebrew words for it. Like how one would wish an Eid Mubarak. 

I ask because as someone who celebrates 3 King’s Day on Jan 6th, I’ll say “feliz día de los reyes magos” with family, but happy three kings day with non-Spanish speakers/Latinos. 
If a non Spanish speaker were to try to say the holiday greeting in Spanish to me, I’d probably just be confused. 

For example: for Rosh Hashanah, should I say happy new year, happy Rosh Hashanah or shanah Tovah? And would this apply to other Jewish holidays?"

Beit dinim, this rabbi and that rabbi, the sephardi, the rosh yeshiva, the chabad rabbi, the modox guy -- I've heard many viewpoints about the status of orthodoxy. It is clear to me that this is one of the most highly political arenas I've ever entered, and I used to work in Washington DC. 

Reddit Jews, I'd like your input about hashgafa. It's a relatively new concept for me that I realize is very essential. This is because bzh I will marry soon (single but davening), and should know my hardlines. Being baalas teshuva, my mother will ask me: ""are you going to shave your head? Will men and women dance separately at your wedding?"" No! I am modern but connect to torah and our tradition deeply. I don't believe torah exists in a vacuum or that a status of being a good jew is limited to Lakewood.

I  want to live as much as possible as a talmudic jew with modern considerations. Clear boundaries on shabbos, kashrut and niddah. But honestly I would eat in a vegan restaurant. It's not ideal but I would do it. I care about tzadikim but don't need photos of them in my house. I'm not meticulous, I'm growing and I'm comfortable growing. 

&#x200B;

What is most important to me is cultivating a kosher, holy environment, and treating both Jews and gentiles as parts of Hashem's precious creation.

Halachos for sure will play a role in my life because I see them as a guide to life. I however as baalas teshuva want to choose a route of yiddishkeit that is sustainable. I don't want to go OTD. I don't want my kids to go OTD. I  want clarity, unity, and to live modernly and jewishly with the torah and the teachings of chazal etc.

I would appreciate input on the nuances of hashgafot as well as matters that I might be blind to at the moment?"

I decided to dive into the Israeli IT sector's job statistics and create a visualization that could offer insights to job seekers like myself. 

[https://jobflow-israel.web.app/](https://jobflow-israel.web.app/)

**Project Overview:**

I've scraped valuable data from GlassDoor using Selenium, performed data cleaning and feature engineering, and hosted the project using Reach and Firebase. The result? JobFlow, a comprehensive tool that presents a variety of statistics and graphs about the IT job landscape in Israel. 

**What You'll Find:** 

Curious about job trends, demand for specific skills, or how salaries are distributed? JobFlow has got you covered. The visualizations highlight key insights that can aid job seekers, career planners, and anyone interested in the tech industry. 

**Why Israel?** 

While I'm based in Israel and on the hunt for my next opportunity, I've designed JobFlow in such a way that it can be pretty easily adapted for any country. 

&#x200B;

If you're interested in exploring the project further, feel free to dive into the [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/Qehbr/JobFlow-Israel) where you can find the source code and project details.

If you find value in this project and think it could benefit others, I'd greatly appreciate an upvote to help spread the word!

Shalom!

My husband and I are embarking on our Aliyah journey, and I have a few pragmatic inquiries. While these concerns aren't directly tied to the Aliyah process, I hope this is the appropriate platform to ask. If not, any recommendations for a better platform would be appreciated.

Regarding my professional and academic background:

* I'm currently pursuing my PhD in a social science discipline and am engaged in research within this domain. Additionally, I work as a researcher in a private company in the same field.
* I'm proficient in three languages, though Hebrew isn't among them yet (but i start the duolingo:((( :D )
* My commitment isn't solely to academia. I have a keen interest in roles like social work (although my current language barrier might pose challenges). I'm also inclined towards working with children and assisting women during childbirth, though I don't possess formal qualifications in these areas.

Given my background and skills, what career paths would you suggest in Israel? Which sectors might offer the most accessible opportunities for someone with my profile? (For reference, I'm 27 years old.)

Thank you immensely for your guidance!

This version presents your information in a more structured manner and with a clearer tone.

Looking for podcasts (preferably UK based as I may understand the terms better, but doesn't matter if elsewhere) for general Jewish learning.

I listen to Jonny Gould's Jewish State which is more about UK/Israel and Zionism related subjects, however looking for something more for torah study, general practices for yom tovs, reasons for doing certain things etc.

Quite broad question and subject matter but hoping someone can point me in the right direction. Just something for the background on my commutes to/from work.

For context, I recently moved from Reform to Orthodox, so have learned a few things but keen to learn more!"

I'm looking for advice - I'm into early Christian history and want to do a tour of Nazareth, Sea of Galilee, River Jordan, Jericho and Jerusalem. The catch is that after getting the bus to Nazareth I want to do it all on a bicycle.

\[This image\]([https://imgur.com/a/3toOLLN](https://imgur.com/a/3toOLLN)) shows my approximate route. Idea is to circle the Sea of Galilee, then travel on the Israeli side of the River Jordan down south.

How feasible is this? Pardon my ignorance but I don't really know the significance of e.g. the 1949 Armistice Agreement Line and other dotted borders on the maps. Is my route pretty accessible or would the whole idea be frowned upon and blocked by border crossings etc?

I have an even crazier idea that some nights I could sleep rough on the trip, like find somewhere quiet to throw down a lightweight mattress and tent. Crazy?

The thing is that I never felt catholic at all, when I was a kid I was more afraid of what will happen to me in hell if I lied to someone than love for a figure like jesus, before my grandmother (dad's mom) passed (2012), she gave my mom a necklace with the star of David on it and a bracelet with the star and the colors of the Israel flag, and she said ""don't let this kids forget their religion like my own did"", my mom never understand this because she always thought that my grandma was an Adventist and she was a catholic. So the other day my mom told me all of this and that's when I remembered the Torah I found in their house and everything pieced together. I tried looking for info about my grandma and I can't find anything, my dad only say to me that they didn't celebrate Christmas and didn't go to the church, but when he was 15, he went alone to get baptized in a catholic church with a friend and that's it. So I want to get reconnect with my grandma's beliefs, I already feel like this is the correct thing to do and she wanted this for me, how can I start? 

TLDR: I never knew my grandma was Jewish and now I want to reconnect with her.

Thanks for reading me."

I was having a discussion with local moms about which holidays were appropriate for kids to celebrate at school, and I realized I wasn't completely sure which holidays should count as religious. Obviously, Christmas and Easter are religious. I know many observant Jews don't do Halloween. But I wasn't sure of the status of Thanksgiving, Valentine's Day, and St. Patrick's Day, which all have some ties to Christianity but are basically treated as secular holidays here in the US. 

I grew up in a secular/interfaith household, so we did all the holidays including Christmas and Easter (tree and bunnies, no Jesus), but I know most Jews wouldn't do that.

So, what do you celebrate/avoid and what's your level/style of observance?"

So here's where I'm hoping the community can help me out a bit ...

* I've attached a picture of my handwritten signature. Can a native speaker or someone with more experience critique it and give me some tips on how to write more legibly? In case my handwriting's very bad, I'm writing שמעון בן מאיר נחמן.
* My friend (the groom, unsurprisingly) is not sure if I should be signing in cursive/script or block writing. I'm assuming cursive ... if it's block I can do that OK, but I think it looks a lot worse.

I don't really understand it.

Even from the outside, if someone came over to your house and you explained the house rules and they said those are good rules, I'll follow them, why would that upset you?

From the inside, this was my understanding of Gentiles and Torah:
Exodus 12:38 A mixed multitude also went up with them, and very much livestock, both flocks and herds.
Many non-Israelites left Egypt with Moses in the Exodus.
Exodus 12:49 There shall be one law for the native and for the stranger who sojourns among you.”
There was one manner of law, the same for Israelites as for Gentiles who wished to sojourn among the Israelites, as [at least 7 verses in Torah show](https://www.openbible.info/labs/cross-references/search?q=Leviticus+24%3A22).
While it isn't in Torah, the book of Ruth in the Ketuvim is all about a Moabitess who wished to join herself to the nation of Israel. No one forbid her or calls her a cosplayer, but rather she is seen as righteous and blessed for it.

Reading all of that, some of the stuff I've read on here against Gentiles kind of confuses me. Would appreciate someone clearing it up for me. Thank you in advance."

(Even though the installation was supposed to be free, he told me he had to do some special extra work). I agreed because he said it was only a few hundred shekels more than the installation itself. A couple of hours later I searched the company he represented in Google where the reviews were all saying it was a scam and to stay away.  I decided to cancel the purchase and just asked that I could pay only for the installation and get my money back for the warranty. He agreed and promised to return the money and that I would see it in my credit card as credit within a few days. This phone call where he agreed I happened to record just in case of something. For two weeks now I haven’t seen the money returned. I tried to get the esmachta from the company but they are unreachable. They keep sending me different numbers to call and each one says someone will return my phone call the same day but no one does. 

Today I called and it reached a woman who told me that this business as of a few days ago no longer exists. The credit card company says without the esmachta paper they cannot do anything. The payment as of now is 1680nis and going in 5 payments, one of which has already been paid. Is there anything I can do to stop the rest of the payments?"

They were so accommodating about my having only a dairy kitchen and very friendly. It was easy to get help 1 page form to fill out with super basic info and needed to see ID+  proof of residence.

For instance in Lebanon, Muslims and Christians have fought together on occasion.  It's a very complex geopolitical, historical, social, and theological matrix, but this is what we're here for.  Would any Muslims support this, Palestinian, Jordanian, Lebanese, European, etc.?  And lets say we want to motivate Christians to actually support this modern crusade, would you be willing to grant them a portion of the territory, somewhere that is less important to Muslims, like other than Jerusalem, but maybe somewhere Jesus still is known to have walked?"

I’m trying to find evidence of supposed Jewish heritage in my family. My mother was adopted as a baby and her adoptive mother was not a nice person. The only information my “grandmother” ever gave my mother is that her biological mother was a Jewish teenager that didn’t want her. It’s entirely possible my grandmother the evil witch she is lied because she thought this was an insult or thought it would be funny to watch my mom chase the red herring I can’t be sure. 

My mother spent many years looking but to my knowledge was unable to find anything this was pre-internet though so hopefully I have better luck. I think she was born in Louisville, Kentucky but can’t be sure. My grandmother may have documents but she’s unfortunately still alive somehow sustained by bitterness so I probably won’t be able to find them for years. 

My mother passed away a few years ago. I’m not really sure why I want to know but I would like to carry-on the search. I’d be very appreciative of any advice on possible sources. Thanks in advance for any help."

I don't think it's often something so explicit someone will say to you out loud - it's often more subtle and people will treat you much differently - like you're a leper - after you disclose your line of work. also, i think it's mostly something that occurs within more wealthy, westernized jewish communities but it may exist elsewhere too.

I find this extremely ironic given the history of antisemitic persecution and how jews were not allowed to receive higher education and were not allowed to enter more prestigious professions like medicine. nowadays, obviously thing are different and probably the majority of at least western jewery hold university education and work as professionals. but still, i don't understand why it's seen as ""acceptable"" to discount jews based on their income level or line of work. of course this is a superficial way that people of any race or religion will often judge one another's perceived ""status"" in modern society but it just seems exceptionally prevalent in the western jewish community since we are a small group comparatively and it's only seen as ""acceptable"" to be one or a few archetypes of a jew.

for example, EVERY single jewish event geared towards young people is billed as ""young professionals"". Are you not welcomed to attend these events if you're a jewish and work as a mechanic or something?"

Tbh I recently deleted Tiktok because there’s way too much bs on there and it enraged me to see so much propaganda being pushed as truth. 

I’ve also noticed a strange group of people who will literally visit Israel and live with their Israeli relatives… but call the country Palestine?? 

For example: there was this one girl who visited her family in Haifa and kept calling it Palestine and saying her Arab family was Palestinian. Is this possible? Or were they just Israeli Arabs. 

Idk it’s just weird that they will visit Israel… live there… and yet still call it Palestine?? Like why are you there then. Is this common in Israel, do you have people who will reap the benefits of Israel yet still call it Palestine?

Just want to know what you guys think about that or what that is about… Sorry if my question doesn’t make sense.

SO, Disney decided to cast the very talented Jewish actor in their new series, ""Ahsoka."" He's great, and I loved him on ""House."" But man...why did they feel the need to cast a stereotypically nebbishy Jew as the greedy industrialist traitor? I can't be the only one thinking WTF, man?! It's not as bad in my opinion as Watto (a bald-faced Shylock charicature), but it still bugged me. Am I overreacting, or is there some subtle antisemitism going on here?

I say return in quotes because I wasn't raised with a Jewish upbringing, my grandmother was put into a cath---c school and wasn't given the option to explore her Jewishness. My mother didn't exactly mind being Jewish and never really thought about it.

I'm currently part of a ch----h and I thought I was an ethnically Jewish C----tian, I was under the impression until a few days ago that Mes----nic Judaism was a *thing* that I could do, until I actually did some research and realised that they weren't compatible.

I thought I was fine by just being an ethnically Jewish C----tian, but the more I learn about the Jewish faith (particularly why Jews don't accept J---s as the mes---h) I'm having a cheeky little crisis because it makes more sense than faith in J-----s.

I realise that I would probably still attend my ch----h, and possibly others, just not to participate (Ch----h of England is quite relaxed): s--mons are interesting, I'm an organist (hope to get a job as one in the future, regardless of where my faith takes me), and some of the people in my ch---h I consider very close friends and even family (my godparents are very precious to me).

This is causing me a huge amount of stress and I've got no one to talk this over with, except a few friends who couldn't really give me answers. I want to talk to my pr--st (who's very knowledgeable about Judaism) and my godparents (kinda their job, but I don't want them to try and convince to towards C----tianity), but I'm scared they'll view me differently if they find out I'm losing my faith in J----s and am seriously considering Judaism. They were both very accepting when I told them that I was Jewish and followed kosher rules (as a way to connect to my heritage).

I kind of have a half certain resolution that I really am religiously Jewish. A few months ago when I didn't have this inner struggle, I filled in some parts of my UCAS application. I realised that 'Jewish' to describe my religious and identity described me perfectly. Someone who is Jewish but attends ch---h out of interest in the music and theology (and notably because there are a lack of synagogues in my corner of England) is the best way I can describe what I think I am?

But I do have questions for when I become an adult and start attending uni in a city with the option of attending a synagogue:

Do I need to have a bat mitzvah? Am I just going to be accepted or do I need to go through formal conversion (I can't prove my Jewish heritage, except for my grandmother's obvious Jewish maiden surname)? My name is of Hebrew origin (named after one of the prophets) so is that my 'Hebrew Name' I see on synagogue application forms? Is it normal to attend a synagogue for the first time at 18?

I'm struggling with the stress and loneliness of the realisation that Judaism makes sense (although there is joy too! the world does finally feel to be falling into place), mostly because I don't know any religiously Jewish people for miles around (the only Jewish person I know is a Jewish C----tian and I'd rather talk to my C---tian godfather).

I just think this is all terribly ironic since I was given a book called 'Simply C----tian' at my baptism."

""This was the custom of the majority of Jews and the gedolei Yisrael, who were not meticulous to check food as today’s machmirim instruct. [This position] is proven from the Talmud, Rishonim, Rambam, and the Shulchan Aruch, which do not elaborate on the laws of checking shratzim for every vegetable or fruit in a detailed manner as they should have if, indeed, a potential Torah or rabbinic prohibition is involved. They also did not prescribe necessary instructions for checking for shratzim…. [They did not rule that] the examination should be done in the sun, and not in houses which were poorly lit…. They also did not demand that experts deal with checking the bugs, but rather relied on anyone’s checking…. Among those inclined to be lenient: Rabbi Feinstein, Igrot Moshe, Yoreh De’ah 4:2; Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, Minchat Shlomo 2:61; Rav Kasar, HaChaim v’ HaShalom, Yoreh De’ah 16; Rabbi Nachum Rabinovitch, Siach Nachum 45; and Rav Amar, Shema Shlomo, vol. 7, Yoreh De’ah 4.”"

Some of my short-form video series include #DafReactions, #ParshaReactions, #JewishHolidayReactions, #AVeryJewishMakeupTutorial, the “Elder Millennials of Zion” skits, and more content on Jewish themes and ideas. 

In the #DafReactions series, I share my practice of daily study of the Babylonian Talmud in the Daf Yomi cycle from the viewpoint of a formerly Orthodox, now secular, Millennial woman. The videos are authentic, with commentary both heartfelt and comedic, putting ancient discourse in direct communication with modern internet culture, pop culture, and current events. 

My role in this project is not as a teacher, nor as a rabbi, but rather as a fellow learner, a fellow traveler, on the path of Jewish text discovery. Through the work, I invite others to walk beside me on this journey and connect with Jewish teachings in ways that are relatable and personally meaningful to *them.*

Previously, I was the first Artist in Residence at Moishe House, and before that I was the host of The Vibe of the Tribe podcast. 

I exist at the intersection of Sefaria and Sephora. And, also in some people’s minds, where I live rent free :-)

The Jewish Virtual Library claims that there were less than 250,000 Palestinian Arabs when jews began to immigrate in 1882, and the vast majority immigrated there recently: [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-claim-to-the-land-of-israel](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-claim-to-the-land-of-israel) 

and I found this comment on a thread in IsraelPalestine: 

*""That's the whole point, the Arab population of Palestine was minimal and nobody took your ""land"". It was territory of low habitation like ""New Zealand"" or any other place colonised over the last centuries. And you just contradicted yourself, saying it was ""hard to move"" but there were also ""no borders or passports"". There was enough ""attraction"" that people from all over the Muslim world moved to Palestine, just as people left the country as well in the other direction. What REALLY brought large numbers from the rural to the city areas was the Zionist enterprise beginning in 1881, and the British government.*

*The evidence of large migration is in the population statistic itself: just a quarter million people in the early 19th century, then 5 times as many people 120 years later. It doesn't add up to any possible increase by natural birth, which is also unnatural itself. The introduction of Western and Jewish development is what allowed Arab women to have so many children AND see them survive into adulthood, without the normal reduction in birthrates that goes with cultural and economic advances historically.*

*The fact is when Arabs and Muslims are in charge, everything falls to pieces.""*

and   


"" [*https://israelipalestinian.procon.org/population-statistics/#graph5*](https://israelipalestinian.procon.org/population-statistics/#graph5)

*Where are these people coming from? It would mean the average Arab woman had 20 + children, all of whom survived to bear their own 20 + children. Most ""Palestinians"" today are Egyptians and Arabic Beduin, besides other impoverished Muslims from the area who are crowded into the UNRWA ""refugee camp"" shantytown system.*

*The Gaza population has multiplied 8 fold in the last 70 years, which is* ***twice*** *the maximum growth rate of the entire world population at the highest birthrate. Meanwhile large numbers of people also left the Gaza Strip, so the population today is probably 80% derived from ""outsiders"" since 1950.""*

Is it really true that it's impossible for the population to multiply 5 fold in 120 years or multiple 8 fold in 70 years without the majority being from immigrants?"

One of the managers (I hesitate to call her that, she’s technically just the owners mom) found out why i don’t work friday nights and told me that “sometimes real life gets in the way and you need to be an adult about it” and that she was going to “look into it” to make sure I wasn’t lying about the hours i needed off. She came back and told me that her “rabbi friend” told her that shabbat is 6pm-6pm, all year round regardless of the season. Obviously, I told her that isn’t true and tried to explain to her that it’s closer to 8:30 that time of year, and I told her that my time off specifically needs to include time for Friday night services at 7. She told me my temple was “wrong” and that no temple would have services before shabbat started. I refused to budge and she told me it was fine if i just wanted the time off just because, and she left it alone. Since then I have been prompted to provide a letter from my rabbi stating that hours i gave are accurate for documentation. 

I thought the mess was done with, until my job decided everyone needs to be available to work for 50% of the shifts available to them (roughly 20 shifts a week). I’m a full time student and this very much was not possible. My manager called me in to discuss “finding a solution or considering parting ways”. I asked her if they were expecting to give up my friday-saturday, to which she said yes, which i said was unreasonable and disrespectful. She said i could work 1-2 hosting shifts a week (less than a hundred dollars) but would not be able to wait tables without more availability. They very much were refusing to fire me, though she showed conversations with our GM where he discussed “parting ways” with me, so it was obvious what position i was in. Obviously I quit. Extremely pissed off but honestly relieved, they had been treating me like shit for months and I was over it."

To be honest, I strangely felt more Jewish during the Introduction to Judaism course than I have afterward. My story is long and I’m uncertain where to begin, but I’ll try to be as concise as possible:

Firstly, I’m physically disabled, and that affects my circumstances. Secondly, I am far less religious now than I used to be. Of course, that may be somewhat related to my situation.

I took a few years to decide on conversion, had a few false starts, and eventually got through the conversion process. I asked my rabbi about the mikveh, but he was somewhat dismissive of the idea. Besides that, my disability would make it difficult to complete (and possibly impossible to do a “kosher” dip). At first I was relieved that I wouldn’t be pressured into doing it, but now I’m left with the feeling that I am somehow less Jewish. I know that the Reform Movement doesn’t require it, but my insecurity is still getting the better of me. Also, the wording on my certificate mentions something about my intention to get it done - which I’m not really sure is something I can ever achieve. Needless to say, I’m frustrated.

On top of that, life has thrown us all some curveballs over the last few years, and I never got established into a community. In fact, my rabbi moved to another state and the synagogue I converted through dissolved during the pandemic. Combine these challenges with my shifting ideas about religion, and I became very wishy-washy about my beliefs. I even tried going back to my previous religion, just because I had gotten into such a bad head space (I was also motivated by some intense grief at the time, but I won’t go into details). I now realize that was just me trying to feel a sense of belonging by finding comfort in something from my past.

Now, I’m trying to find my way back, and I just felt the need to share. Has anyone else converted without going to the mikveh? Or can anyone relate in some other way to my journey? I could really use some moral support."

In 2002 I met my wife, a secular Jewish girl (brought up in a reform temple but two generations removed from orthodox Judaism) and we got married in 2006 in a mixed ceremony (at the insistence of my family).  Now we have two beautiful children we are raising as culturally Jewish, not religious).  Over the years I've grown closer to her family and having Jewish kids has opened my eyes up to the rampant anti-semitism in our society from both the Left and the Right, in particular in our Brooklyn neighborhood.  We've hid our cultural identity for 20 years from just about everyone.  I realize now that doing so doesn't help the problem.

It has made me believe in the power of the collective, and I feel it's my duty to convert so I can be a full part of my family unit in every way. However, as I'm not religious, I can't seem to find a congregation, nor do I honestly want to participate in one, that fits the cultural identity of our family.  Is there an official place for me in Jewish culture?  I participate in all the family holidays, and enjoy all of the things my wife and kids do as cultural Jews.  How does that work for someone like me who wants to fully be a part of my family's experience? Spiritually there are so many great things that I do agree with (especially related to the after life where there are a NUMBER of beliefs which seem to align with my agnostic/atheist beliefs).  I also have some distant Jewish family members, some of whom now live in Israel, which I've begun to see as a potential haven for future generations of our family.

Long story short, is there a way to culturally convert? If so, whats the process like?"

1,2023-08-25,The Astonishing Secret of Yehoram Gaon’s Hit Song “Gesher Allenby” and the assasination of Abdullah I,u/Itay1708,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/160x1ep/the_astonishing_secret_of_yehoram_gaons_hit_song/," 

The Astonishing Secret of Yehoram Gaon’s Hit Song “Gesher Allenby”

I’m sure many of you know the 1969 hit song “Gesher Allenby” by Yehoram Gaon which sings about an Arab man named Abdullah crossing the border from Israel to Jordan through the recently opened Alleby Bridge during the time of Israel’s Open Bridge Policy following the six day war.

The song at first seems unassuming and normal. However, there is a line in the third base which raises some questions:

עבדאללה אפני הגיע ממכה

העיר הקדושה שבארץ חיג'אז

Abdullah Efendi came from Mecca

The holy city in the land of Hejaz

Now, this raises some interesting questions. First of all, how did Abdullah come from Mecca if he is crossing from Israel to Jordan? Israel did not allow non-Jewish immigration before the song takes place, and as such there is no way he immigrated from Mecca, and with his name being Abdullah, meaning servant of Allah, it is obvious he is muslim.But, there is an explanation.

Now, there is another person named Abdullah who came from Mecca.

 

https://preview.redd.it/6wub694qv8kb1.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=62cc21352f3d46f34ad8b6a9955b2f3c50b3e097

Meet King Abdullah I of Jordan. Song of Hussein, King of the Arabs, he was the first king of the Emirate of Transjordan and the leader of Jordan until 1951. You may ask yourself, how is this possible? Everyone knows that Abdullah was assasinated in 1951 at the Al-Aqsa Mosque by a Palestinian nationalist. So, it can’t be him, right?  
Wrong.

Abdullah was assasinated due to his attempts to negotiate a full peace treaty with the newly established State of Israel. His heir, Talal, was suffering from Schizophrenia at the time of his death, and as such, it was possible that Talal’s state would cause the collapse of the Hashemite monarchy and bring about a nationalist state with a more aggressive stance toward Israel.  


It is entirely possible that knowing his position was in dire danger, Abdullah reached out to contacts in Israel for political asylum. Now the Israeli public, having been at war with Jordan only 2 years beforehand, would not support such a thing, and as such it would be kept secret. But David Ben-Gurion would not approve of such a thing due to his harsh stance against the Arabs of Israel, imposing martial law on them. There is someone who would though.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bosvfwurv8kb1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b13433f298b4e6067ecafebe4d54b5cbcf580024

Meet Pinchas Rosen. 1st Justice Minister of Israel, leader of the Progressive Party, friend of David Ben-Gurion and suspiciously relevant to our theory, Reuven Shiloah, first director of the Mossad. Coincidence? I think not.

Why would Rosen do such a thing? Well, it’s not too complicated. The Progressive Party was a close ally of Ben-Gurion’s Mapai, but their one major policy difference had to do with Ben-Gurion’s continued martial law on Arab population centres, which Rosen did not support. It is entirely possible that Pinchas Rosen used his ties in the Mossad to secretly escort Abdullah out of Jordan to prevent his assasination. 

Now, you may ask, why does the song, released in 1969, have anything to do with this? It’s pretty simple.

Preceding the 1961 elections, Rosen’s Progressive Party merged with Peretz Bernstein’s General Zionists to form the Liberal party. This party would slowly undermine Rosen, and when part of the party merged with Menachem Begin’s Herut to form Gahal, Rosen was furious. He left the party to form the Independent Liberals party, however it was not very successful and he would resign from the Knesset in 1968, which coincidentally coincides with Meir Amit’s resignation as head of the Mossad. 

Putting these facts together, we can assume that Abdullah, who was living in exile for almost 20 years, fearing that his protection would evaporate, was given a fake ID and passport so he could escape back to Jordan. He might have made contact with King Hussein and advised him on how to deal with the palestinian coup from 1970-71 and not to go to war with Israel in 1973.

Edit: Important disclaimer! - I am not talking about Arabs as a whole, Arabs that want to be and are part of the Israeli society are nothing short of our (or at least my) brothers, and Arabs who want to live peacefully in a Palestinian state shouldn't take offence in this post either

Original post -

I think that us Israelis have internalized and normalized, what seeming nobody outside of Israel grasps, this distinction needs to be something that is mentioned at the beginning of every Israel - Palestine debate

***Let's take a look at other famous conflicts -***

Ukraine - If Ukraine losses, Ukraine losses its democracy and become a puppet to Russia, Ukrainians still living, but under Russian indirect rule

Taiwan - If China attacks Taiwan, and Taiwan losses, Taiwan losses its identity and becomes part of China, Taiwanese still living, but as Chinese

South Korea - If South Korea losses to North Korea, South Koreans become part of a unified Korea - South Koreans continue to live, but under worse conditions in a brutal dictatorship

India <-> Pakistan (Kashmir) - The winner gets a hold of Kashmir region and the population there becomes citizens of the winner, obviously, they continue to live

&#x200B;

***Now, let's look at Israel's enemies -***

Iran \-   [Israel should be wiped off map, says Iran's president](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/27/israel.iran)

Hamas \- [Hamas' original charter says](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp)

""The Day of Judgment will not come about until Moslems fight Jews and kill them. Then, the Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will cry out: 'O Moslem, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him.'""

(Article 7)

&#x200B;

Looking back at Israel's old wars, where armies of 7 armies ganged up on Israel, in times where they could temporarily capture Israeli villages, they killed every single person living in it

""From November 29, 1947, Kfar Etzion was under siege and cut off from Jerusalem. On May 13, 1948, when the village surrendered, 127 Jewish inhabitants [were massacred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kfar_Etzion_massacre) by local village irregulars, with the possible involvement of the [Arab Legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Legion).[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Etzion#cite_note-8) The other villages surrendered the next day. The inhabitants were taken prisoner and the homes were plundered and burned.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Etzion#cite_note-9)""

&#x200B;

In both regions of the Palestinian controlled territories they had 1 free elections (when other countries enforced it), which immediately turned into dictatorship (which throws the 'one state solution' out the window, as Israelis won't give up on their democracy \[don't mention the reforms... don't mention the reforms... don't mention the reforms...\])

In the first region Hamas was elected, which I spoke about above

In the second region Fatah is in control, who spends more than half of its budget on the Pay for Slay system, which is paying stipends to terrorists (or their families if they died while commiting Jihad), the more Israelis killed, the more money they earn

The statement is just another instance of clear Apartheid policies and rhetoric. Even the US condemned his racist statement… Ben-Gvir is not a random commentator, but he is the person responsible for the policies affecting the lives of Palestinians and their movement.. so his words do in fact represent what the government is doing and cannot be detached from it.


It is quite shocking however how many people are still defending him. Another sign of how normalised and internalised this Apartheid rhetoric is , so that people do not really see what’s wrong. At the same time, many Israelis also seem to be angered and opposed to what he said. This is however even more shocking, as it is a well known fact that the freedom of movement situation applies differently to Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank. This is already the policy. Why would they be angry just because he said it explicitly? .. 
some seem to be worried only about the image of Israel, and don’t really care about the actual policy in the West Bank... as many tweets and commentators that are opposed to him and bibi’s government are saying ( like: ‘this is a gift to Israel’s haters’…and so on).."

I recently learned that many of my ancestors were Jewish and that some of them had forefathers in the Davidic dynasty ancestral line (I understand this to mean that they were descendants of King David). At one place in the family line, there are some ancestors who appear to be descendants of Judah and others of Levi. 

Learning this has sparked an interest in me to learn more about Judaism and this part of our heritage that my family seems to have lost, so I have been reading some books about it and streaming Shabbat services. I have a few questions now, and would really appreciate it if anyone could weigh in with your thoughts. 

My first question is - do you think I would be welcome to attend Shabbat services at a synagogue or to visit their learning library even though I am not Jewish? Or would my presence be seen as an intrusion? 

Second - I want to learn to read Hebrew. Are you aware of any free online resources or books that I could start with right now while I’m on a budget?

Lastly - I’d love to learn more about remarkable Jewish women throughout history. Are there any you think I should read about first?

My great grandparents were Orthodox Jews, so was my grandfather until he decided to marry a christian woman in his twenties and he was expulsed from the community and thrown into the streets, my father had a very rough childhood, he grew up very poor and resenting the rest of the family that is apparently quite wealthy,  he was really antisemitic, blaming Judaism for everything wrong in his life and in the world, into conspiracies and all that.

I never shared my father's bigoted beliefs and wondered a lot if there was more to the story than that but mentioning the topic only made him go on rants about how awful my grandpa's family is, I know he did meet them at some point but no idea how or why it happened, only that it obviously didn't go well.

When I was in my early twenties I met one of my father's cousins that asked about my last name and when I told him who I was he looked at me with disgust, excused himself and walked away, that was my only interaction with that side of the family.

My questions is then, does this happen sometimes in Orthodox families? Not in the sense of it being common or right but it being known to happen, like when christians cut contact with gay family members, or could there be other reasons for it? If it does or if Jewish members get excommunicated from other reasons is it the norm for the contact ban to apply to their descendants too?

I'm sorry if I said something wrong or used the wrong word in the post, it's hard for me to believe that this stuff could happen regularly but even if it does sometimes it wouldn't affect my view of Jewish people as whole, every group has bigots/assholes/abusers etc."

I'm about to turn off my phone for Shabbat, but I have a quick question.  


I'm curious about the strangest thing someone has told you after you've disclosed your Jewish heritage or faith to someone.   


I can start:  
1. You don't look Jewish  
2. Did you know only 600,000 people died in the Holocaust?  
3. But you're like okay with Jewish jokes, right? (He specifically meant antisemitic jokes.)  
4. I could tell by your posture

The class itself costs money, which I expected. However, I just found out that the synagogue itself charges an additional fee for the actual conversion process, and I don't know if this is normal or not (I've seen some people say it is, others that is isn't, I'm just unsure). The website says this:

""This fee covers individual sessions with the rabbi you are working with, a subsidy towards a Hebrew reading class (if you choose to take it), and one years membership at \[synagogue\] following conversion.""

I get a Hebrew class costing money as well as membership, but those two things on their website don't add up to the $400 they're asking for. It reminds me of a scandal some years ago of people shaming a non-jewish woman for ""paying her way"" through conversion, but I don't know if that's what this is or not. Is it typical for rabbis to charge a conversion student money?

1,2023-08-26,Surname Change,u/Epic_Finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/161l9r4/surname_change/,"During the 50s and 60s, my grandparents chose to alter our family's surname from one that was distinctly Jewish to a more generic name. There were two reasons for this change: (1) the industry in which my grandfather was employed dealt with anti-Semitism (2) my grandmother didn’t have a great relationship with her in-laws and never cared for the name. My other family members, who still have the surname, never truly understood why they changed it.

It has been around 60 to 70 years since the name change, and I find myself somewhat distanced from the Jewish community. You would be surprise by how many people react with surprise when they learn that I'm Jewish…the new surname is REALLY GENERIC. I have considered going back to the original name, but I am always on the fence about it since everyone knows me by my current name. Would be interested if anyone else has considered this in the past."

He is a YouTuber with about 97k Subs and his Anti-Israel videos are pretty popular. 

This YouTuber is the perfect example of someone who posts half truths as some of the things he does say are true but many times heavily exaggerated. 

For starters, He seems to be kind of like a Bad Empanada of sorts as he makes a lot of content about the West and the “crimes” they commit. I’ve watched a few of his videos, 1 titled “How Israel Lies About Literally Everything” and another “The Conflict Based on a Lie” and I will explain shortly what I’ve found wrong here. 

For starters, he seems to dishonestly leave out important refutations to the allegations he makes and seems to word his videos in a way that Israel has never been a victim and Palestine has never done a single thing wrong. 1 of them was about how Israel bombs Gaza yet he conveniently doesn’t mention the terrorist bases or how Hamas force’s civilians to stay in buildings. Another was when he was talking about East Jerusalem and the displacement of Palestinians, he fails to mention that a lot of it is because Jordan stole a lot of Jewish land in the war. 

The biggest issue to his videos is how he leaves out a lot of History on the region, Genetics, Palestinian attacks and how (in this case the 6 day war), he paints Israel out as the primary aggressor and talks about things Israel did but not about war crimes committed by Egypt and Syria.

When he cites sources, the ones he always mentions are from sources like Israeli opposition, Haaretz, HRW and Al Jazeera. All these sources are Politically Bias and many of them such as HRW and Al Jazeera have frequently been exposed for Antisemitism and Terrorist glorification. 

I’m writing this purely because this person is gaining followers and wanted to point out the hypocrisy and dishonesty this guy seems to have. His videos can easily be debunked with reliable and often photographic sources. 

Let me know if you have watched his content and what your opinion is."

I’m jewish and he knew that because I posted sometimes judaism related stuff. I have been thinking about getting a hebrew tattoo for a year back then but I never felt like I was good enough to get it because I didn’t grow up in a religious household and was also very disconnected from my heritage. I did so much to be in touch with my jewishness and religion but I was constantly doubting myself. 
He never asked things about judaism so it was a huge surprise to me, when he announced that he was getting a hebrew tattoo with his best friend. None of them knew anything about judaism, as said before and it kind of made me upset that he can just decide, out of nowhere, that he’s getting a hebrew tattoo. Without even knowing what idk Hanukkah or Rosh Hashanah is. 
Anyway, I didn’t let my feelings show and instead told him that getting the tattoo on a visible body part (his arm) might cause him some trouble because of the country we live in. People might think he’s jewish and hatecrime him or something. And then he said “Do I look like a jew??!”, like he was offended. He is half chinese and he probably thought that jews look a certain way, as if chinese people couldn’t be jewish. 
This response just made me dislike him even more and after he got the tattoo and showed it to me, I cut contact with him. I didn’t want to call him out because he was already tone deaf when it came to his mild misogyny. 
The letters looked like they were written by a 5 year old but of course none of those guys were able to tell because, again, they knew nothing about hebrew or jews. This all happened like a year ago and he has been texting me since, every now and then, asking what he did wrong. I started feeling bad I wonder if I was too harsh or if I should’ve done things differently. What do you think?"

I just wanted one of my main characters to have a military background and recently got into a rabbit hole of the Israel history and it's never ending conflicts. So I just wanted to ask: what did Tzahal soldiers felt during that times? How they lived? What motivated them to go into army? Was it a will to protect their motherland? Poverty? Or maybe revenge? What was their moral compass? Were they peacemakers or more of a ruthless killers? Basically EVERYTHING about them in those times. It would be really great if you had some sort of interview or battle diaries of Tzahal soldiers. Also, pardon my English please, it is not my first language (there maybe a strange and awkward use of words, pardon me for that too).

Anyone with basic map reading skills can see that the Rafah border crossing doesnt even border Israel and from what I understand no Israeli has been within miles of the place for decades. Egypt could just as easily let unlimited goods flow in and out of Gaza.

Let's Discuss 🐦👗 #LGBTQ+""",u/abeecrombie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/162e4ld/unpacking_torahs_surprising_combo_genderblurring/,"In this week's Parashah Ki Tetzei, we encounter a unique pairing of mitzvot that piques curiosity and raises questions. 

In direct order, hashem commands against cross-dressing, the next  cimmandman introduces the practice of Shiluach HaKen, showing compassion to mother birds. 

What could be the underlying link between these distinct mitzvot? 

 In rabbinical sources prior to 1900, the juxtaposition of the commandment against cross-dressing (Deuteronomy 22:5) and the practice of Shiluach HaKen is often explained as a reflection of compassion and sensitivity.

Rabbinic commentators such as Rashi (1040–1105) and Ibn Ezra (1089–1167) have noted that both commandments emphasize compassion. Just as Shiluach HaKen demonstrates concern for the mother bird before taking her eggs, the clothing commandment underscores the importance of maintaining clear gender distinctions to prevent confusion and emotional distress.

Furthermore, this pairing may be intended to emphasize the significance of respecting divinely ordained boundaries. Just as species have distinct roles, the genders' roles are also distinct, and straying from these boundaries might lead to confusion and disorder. This perspective can be found in commentaries such as those of Ramban (1194–1270) and Seforno (1470–1550).

These interpretations, founded in compassion and reverence for divine order, shed light on the rationale behind grouping these commandments within the same section.

Ever since that incident, I have been experiencing a strange discomfort because I do not have much knowledge about Jewish traditions or Judaism. I am concerned about unintentionally offending anyone by singing a song that holds significant meaning beyond being simply a catchy tune. Although I googled it and it is about celebration!

1,2023-08-27,"Support of Palestine is not a support of Hamas' evils, support of Israel is not a support of the IDF's evils. A response to /u/OssamaBinHiding's post from yesterday",u/tsvthrowaway24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/162hr3b/support_of_palestine_is_not_a_support_of_hamas/,"First of all, I want to be fully transparent. I'm a non-Jewish American, never been to Israel or anywhere in the area. I do have a good amount of Jewish friends (my school has a good JS program), a few who are Israeli and other's who have been on birthright etc--all with a range of opinions on the Israel-Palestine conflict. I myself would definitely be considered pro-Palestine or perhaps Anti-Zionist, but consider an amicable-if unfeasible-two state solution to be the best outcome at this point. Just wanted to make my POV clear

Anyways, I wanted to push back against that post from yesterday by u/OssamaBinHiding since I think it's honestly really harmful and represents a common and detrimental aspect of both sides of this whole ""debate."" The primary premise is accurate and reasonable for the most part--many Arab nations/groups do seem to support mass displacement or sometimes even genocide of Israelis, which is uncommon and shocking in the modern world. The attitudes of Hamas and other groups in this case are clearly and undebatable horrific, and should be condemned. My problem with the post from yesterday is that it essentially was trying to equate support for Palestine/opposition to Israel as an endorsement of extremist groups which happen to support the same cause. 

My belief that Israel is and has been treating Palestine horribly does not mean that I support some deranged jihadi who fires missiles from hospitals or kills completely innocent Israelis. 

The same goes for the other side, support of Israelis and their right to security/life does not mean that you support IDF soldiers who shoot children or bomb apartment buildings.

The tribalization of this complex, intimate, and deeply human conflict only pushes us closer to a world where something violent and horrible will inevitably happen, no matter which side is the one to suffer--likely both will. At the end of the day, beyond nations and political orgs, the normal people of both Israel and Palestine are the one's who bear the brunt of the suffering, and hopefully our approach to the problem (on both sides, of course) can keep that in mind. 

All of this of course is a common thing in this hellish new world of online discourse, but with such an impactful and consequential subject we should try our best not to fall into generalistic tribalism.

I'm sure you all are subjected to such generalizations and accusations all the time, probably more than your detractors would depending on the site or environment, but it really helps nobody to be sucked into it yourself. Especially as, presumably, someone who has actual skin in the game: actually living in Israel instead of being some disconnected debate-bro online from the west or whatever (which would describe me too I guess, lmao). 

At the end of the day this type of essentialism is damaging for everyone except extremists in both directions. I have made similar points to people on the other side, and while receptions are mixed I think its important that at least some of us try and navigate all this with the consideration it deserves. I'm not arguing for any type of centrist or indecisive opinion, I just want to push against the distractions and misdirections that this type of tribalism imposes.

I visited religious sites both in Green Line Israel and in the occupied/disputed Palestinian territories. As I did so, it seemed to me as if there was really just one state from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River, Israel, with the Palestinians only having a partially autonomous entity. Sure, there were signs mentioning a ""State of Palestine"" in PA areas but other than that, there didn't seem to be any indication that I entered another sovereign country. So, what exactly can the status quo be described as? One de facto state? Two de facto states? Something else entirely?

This is a case of a settler-colonial state and it's relationship to the indigenous people. That relationship being ""hey let's treat Palestinians as less than human"".

Even if Israel overnight become a peace loving nation that stopped bombing Palestinians, stopped controlling Gaza borders, left the west bank. It would still be appropriate to denounce then as they still exist as a settler-colonial state with very much existing colonized victims.

People would hold this same viewpoint on America and the Natives, they would with the aboriginals of Australia, and with the South Africans during apartheid, yet we give Israel a pass? 

It's because Israel serves the interests of the west and their ruling class. 

The South Africans were liberated from apartheid and thus the state served little purpose to the west beyond trade.

The natives and aboriginals of America and Australia have been so thoroughly subjegated and silenced by the respective states that no longer seem a threat to their ruling classes and thus no longer care. 

But Israel is currently carrying out it's colonial crimes, it's legal apartheid. Israel is of great interest to the west, it's a apartheid state conviently situated in the middle east and next to North Africa. It has military influence over one of the wests regions of interest, it endorses western markets completely, it backs up America in the UN and vice versa regarding their colonial crimes.

So to reiterate I don't like the persona this sub takes on because there is no civil debate about this ""conflict"". There is no nuance to insert into this and anyone who claims to be doing so is most definitely not. It is very simpls, Israel is a colonial state just like America and South Africa and we should denounce it outright. This isn't a ""Israel-palestine conflict"" it's a cultural genocide from a coloniser."

We can fall for the western trap of so-called freedom (while the west ban their women from having abortions) and hate on Saudi, but as a Palestinian, I know that the best road to freeing our country would be to surround our colonizers, and seeing Iran & Saudi make peace, and Syria's war ending, makes me very hopeful for the future.

Full disclosure, I’ve never been the any chabad events, never associated with them. Ive been curious and thinking about going—but this totally has made me make sure I never go because that’s *super weird.*

I was recently reading *The Jewish World: The Cultural Atlas of the World* by Nicholas de Lange (1991), and I came across these lines:

>Confucianism was not hostile to other forms of belief, and no social or political constraints were placed on Chinese Jews. 

>Although the Kaifeng Jews in the last century kept up some distinctive Jewish observances, they had adopted some typical Chinese ones. They knew little Hebrew, and Chinese inscriptions in their synagogues contained Confucian writings, and indeed identified Jewish and Confucian values. Chinese Jewry provides and example of what can happen under conditions of extreme toleration: an effortless assimilation leading to total effacement. 

>In India the toleration and religious syncretism of Hinduism were combined with the social segregation deriving from the caste system. Settlements on the Malabar coast and further north in Konkan were cut off for a long time from the rest of the Jewish world (and from each other); Jews from Europe joined the former in the 16th century. The barrier of the caste system ensured their survival, but it did not prevent them from adopting various Hindu beliefs and practices, and indeed both Jewish communities developed their own internal caste divisions. 

>The Mongols, who overran the eastern lands of Islam in the 13th century, were equally tolerant. “With the Mongols there is neither slave nor free man, neither believer or pagan, neither Christian nor Jew, but they regard all men as belonging to the same stock.” So a contemporary Christian chronicler (Bar Hebraeus) reports, and he goes on to describe how a Jewish physician, Sa’d al-Dawla, became the all-powerful vizier of Mongol ruler Arghun Khan (1284-91). 

>The hope was short-lived, however. On the death of Arghun, Sa’d al-Dawla and his family and protégés were put to death, “and because of him the Jews throughout the world were hated and I’ll treated.” The Mongols soon accepted Islam, and the short spell of toleration ended. 

This is all the book has to say about the Jews of non-Abrahamic Asia. I’m also aware that as an over 30 year book, it’s perspective may be blind to a lot of experiences and perspectives of non-normative Jews. Basically, I would like to know both how accurate this gerneralization is and more information about the Jews of antiquity of non-Abrahamic Asia. The line about Chinese Jewry being what happens when Jews exist in a tolerant society I find to be particularly interesting, and I want to learn how accurate that statement is. 

I am more interested in the more historical and less modern history. I am somewhat interested in modern Jewish life in non-Abrahamic Asia (I found the bit on the jewish community of Harbin from 1896-1985 in *People Love Dead Jews* [2022] to be interesting), but I want to go back further to learn more about the previous history and how it has shaped the experiences of more modern Asian Jews. 

Thanks in advance for any and all academic resources to learn more about this!"

My husband is going to put a bell on my bike today for the first time, any brachot that come to mind that we may say while he affixes it? Obviously there’s no specific bracha for a motorcycle bell, The only thing I can think of that has the right vibe is the tefilat haderech, but that’s a prayer.

in the heart of Tel Aviv, lived an elderly Israeli man named Ezra. He was a kind-hearted grandpa who always had a warm smile on his face. Ezra had spent his entire life working hard and witnessing the growth and development of his beloved country.

However, life had something unexpected in store for him. One fateful day, Ezra received heartbreaking news from his doctor. He had been diagnosed with cancer, an illness that seemed to suffocate his hopes and dreams. The once vibrant and energetic grandpa had now become weak and filled with uncertainty.

As news of his illness spread within the close-knit Israeli community, they rallied around Ezra and his family. His children and grandchildren, who loved him dearly, were determined to do everything they could to help him fight this battle. They spent countless hours by his side, comforting him and researching potential treatment options.

Ezra's condition worsened, and the medical expenses started to pile up. His limited pension barely covered the cost of his daily needs, let alone the expensive treatments necessary to combat the aggressive disease. The family knew that time was of the essence, but the financial burden greatly overwhelmed them.

Help me and my community save Ezra from cancer so that he can continue to live for years to come.

I realized I didn't know \*why\* a minyan is 10 people, and when I asked the table, no one else knew, which was comedic in itself.

Today I googled the history of where *minyan* comes from, and well, to me it feels kinda arbitrary (from Chabad.org):

> The biblical source for the requirement of ten men to complete a *minyan* (lit., “count” or “number”) is [Numbers 14:27](https://www.chabad.org/9942#v27). Moses sent spies to scout the land of Canaan. Ten of them returned and issued a report concluding that it was not a conquerable land. G‑d was extremely disappointed with their lack of faith in His abilities. He turns to Moses and Aaron, telling them: ""How long will this evil ‘assembly’ provoke \[the Jewish nation\] to complain against Me?” From here it is deduced that an “assembly” is comprised of ten men. 

on Wiki, another source says minyan comes from Abraham's please to Gd not to destroy Sodom if there are at least 10 believers [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minyan)"

I guess im just excited and well hoping for the best!

P.S I decided to go with a more political unit, I hope to help the country better itself and think that throwing myself into this at such a young age would temper me into a fair, wise and annoying old man.

Recently, a high school in my city hosted a student fair in which students were to display their educational works. On Facebook, I saw a mother posting photos of her child dressing up as Hitler (down to the beard and the swastika armband) for the school's history club, with her caption saying that WWII is her child's topic of interest and that the purpose wasn't to imitate/impersonate Hitler.

While I'm more than certain that she believes the intention was purely educational and harmless, she did post about it a few hours before the post was taken down (and she made a new post I referred to above), yet the previous post's comment section was filled with troll comments and borderline antisemitism.

Some background: We have been using the Shabbos Mode on our oven during Shabbat and opening and closing the oven door on Shabbat. We know that's a no no. 

Solution: I bought a Plata. A 30 x 18 inch Plata. The idea: Shabbos lunch, if we want to have something warm - We Plata it. ( as long as it's not liquid, and already cooked ). 

Do 2 questions: 

1) What are you Plata best practices ? How do you ensure it safe - that is does burn the counter and the kids don't burn themselves. 

2) Does anyone ever use the warming drawer to warm food on Shabbos? How effective is it ?"

I found there were many deeper, invisible connections between words in Hebrew and between Hebrew and other adjacent languages (esp latin and Ancient Greek). Some linguist ( William Chomsky father of Noam chomsky) said all modern quadro- and triconsonental roots could be deduced to ancient biconsonantal roots, like what I found about r-m ר-ם I believe it's originally meaning is high, pernicious, elevated land and it derived words like rama/ramot רמה/רמות, to raise להרים , and I suppose mountain הר is a backformation from mountains הרים , which is connected with to raise, elevate, להרים, however because of the dubious cutting up of wording, לה-רים became ל-הרים, seemingly to-mountains, hence the mountains הרים was begotten during some period of time in evolution of the language and later it backformed into הר.

Is this theory plausible?"

 To those of you who have changed their religiousness how did it impact your family dynamic, am I wrong for regretting my upbringing when Hashem put me in this exact scenario, and also should I try and help my siblings down this path (like encouraging my brother to wrap tefellin) or should I let them find their own path.

I live in Israel on a student visa (A/2). I am in Europe right now and I am planning to buy a new desktop PC there and bring it to Israel. It is cheaper that way even if I play additional VAT at the airport (even slightly cheaper and much more convenient than buying something similar in Eilat). I am planning to bring it in parts in their original package (mostly in hand luggage) and without the case, which I will buy in Israel. I will assemble the PC here and use if for a brief time, before disassembling and packing it up again.

I have a few questions here:

1. Does anyone have experience with something like this, specifically going through the red channel at the airport? Do I have to file any paperwork beforehand? What else do I have to pay except for VAT?
2. I am a little worried that they will make me to pay tax on other items that I brought with me from Israel already: a Macbook and an Ipad from work, could ask my boss for a receipt, and a Nintendo switch which I have had for a while, but I have no receipt for it. I know that there normally should not be a problem with such items, but I don't know how it is if I do have other things on me that I need to pay tax on.
3. Technically, here: [https://www.gov.il/en/departments/guides/guide-tourist-customs?chapterIndex=3](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/guides/guide-tourist-customs?chapterIndex=3) under 'other items...' it says personal computer. So, technically, I could argue that this is a disassembled, used PC without case. But I also understand that this is a potentially weak case for tax exemption, and I sure wouldn't go through the green channel with it without ascertaining anything. I do not want to break the law as I need my visa extended once or twice more ;).Would it make sense to just go to the red channel and ask 'I have bought a PC in Europe, disassembled it and now bringing it in, do I have to pay taxes?', just in the hope that they might say no? It doesn't seem like I lose anything if they say yes.
4. Anything else for me to consider?
5. EDIT: Someone who I know in Israel told me that I should NOT go through the red channel, since everyone goes through the green one and they will be shocked if I do this, leading to a potentially bad outcome (as in: My headphones having bluetooth making them comms equipment that needs to be declared and so on).  
Instead they said I should just go through green and if there is a problem, just plead ignorance. But is this really a good idea? I am a bit scared to do that.

Thanks a lot in advance!"

1,2023-08-28,Anti-Zionism is unprecedented,u/TracingBullets,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/163jofc/antizionism_is_unprecedented/,"Anti-Zionists have been struggling to get their views inserted into mainstream society, and haven't been successful for a variety of causes. Part of the reason that anti-Zionism is so unpopular, and so often and accurately described as anti-Semitism, is because it’s unprecedented in history. 

Anti-Zionists love to pimp out the Palestinians and claim the reason why they are anti-Zionists is because of the bad things ""Zionism"" has ""done to the Palestinians."" This is a great example of an unprecedented view: Throughout history, many countries have committed horrible, unspeakable atrocities to others. The United States wiped out the Native Americans. The Japanese raped Nanking. The Germans committed the Holocaust and started a world war that killed millions of people. Turkey and the Armenian genocide. Russia and the Holomodor. And the list goes on and on and ON. Anyone with half an education knows that human history is littered with horror.

And yet, in all of that time, at no point were any of the aforementioned countries targeted with an organized movement seeking to remove them from existence. At no point did the UN, the League of Nations, or anyone else say to Germany, for example, “Germany, you committed the Holocaust, therefore your country is no longer allowed to exist. You Germans have lost the right to have your own country.” The worst that ever happened to these countries were condemnations and loss of territory. Of course this isn't counting one country trying to conquer another, because that wasn't an organized activist movement let alone one with self-styled progressive credentials.

Another talking point we hear a lot is ""I don't support Zionism because it happened at the expense of the Palestinians."" Again, the vast majority of countries are created at the expense of someone else, including Palestine itself. The idea that because a country inconvenienced people when it came to exist, and therefore it's okay to remove it from existence, is unprecedented.

The most common example of comparison that anti-Zionists always try to use is the example of apartheid South Africa, and while this comparison is flawed in many, many ways, even the anti-apartheid advocates never wanted South Africa to cease to exist as a state. They just wanted the apartheid laws to be removed. South Africa was not at war with another nation-state, apartheid was an internal issue that needed to be resolved. Palestinian supporters keep trying and arguing that Israel being Jewish is an internal law just like those apartheid laws, and therefore it's fine to change it, is unprecedented too. As Norman Finkelstein has said, third world countries guard their sovereignty jealously, because they know that if the mob comes for Israel today, it could just as easily come for them next.

If anyone has examples of countries that were removed from existence because of bad acts their government did, present them. Ethnic-based nation states remain just as popular as ever today, what with the Palestinians and the Scots advocating for statehood, and I see no reason why Jews and only Jews should be stripped of their state. Anti-Zionists claim to have no knowledge or interest in the existence or conduct of any other ethnic-based nation state other than the Jewish state, and that's a double standard against Jews. There's a reason why so many people think anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism. Because it is."

However, I guess I don’t know if my biological grandma is for sure Jewish, although I assume she is. Would I be considered halachically jewish? 

By the way, I think this system is so dumb, just curious because I just came to Israel."

Let's look at what you support -

The Palestinians identity was created in the 1920's by [Haj Amin Husseini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amin_al-Husseini), a known anti semite and a VIP visitor to H\*tler (link c\_nsored on the s\_b, it is in the pastebin)

In 1948, a day after Israel's declared independence, [the Palestinians launched a genocidal war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War), in which [they murdered every living Jew in villages they briefly captured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kfar_Etzion_massacre).

As a result of this war, Israel captured parts of their territory, while the rest, West Bank and Gaza, were occupied by Jordan and Egypt respectively, during which the Palestinians didn't seem to much care for a state of their own, they only cared about having a country when it helped killing Jews.

In 1993, for the first time in history, [a Palestinian party agreed to recognize Israel as a state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords) and that Jews have a right to live, but under the hood, they spent more than half of their funding and budget (a big chunk of which is aid from European and American governments) to [fund the pay for slay system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority_Martyrs_Fund), which paid pensions for terrorists who killed Israeli civilians, the more killed, the more money they get (and if die while killing Jews, which is often the case, their family gets the pensions instead)

A bit later they also launched the [2nd intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada), which is likely the biggest terror campaign in history, with record high number of suicide bombers in busses and malls

Later on, in 2005, Israel tried again to reach for peace, without an agreement with the Palestinians, who most of the time didn't agree to come to the negotiations table, and in the rest of the time negotiated in bad faith, Israel had decided to completely leave [Gaza to the Palestinians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza), the new city state was given everything it needed to succeed, high tech greenhouse industry, a large amount of work permits in Israel, ability to trade with the world etc etc,

But, as always, killing Jews was a bigger priority, in their first (and last) free elections, they elected Hamas, which immediately started firing unguided rockets at Israeli cities, Israel and Egypt as a response blockaded the strip from the outside world with big walls and naval blockade.

Fast forward to today, [the most popular Palestinian party (in both Gaza and the West Bank) remains Hamas](https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-72-of-palestinians-support-forming-more-armed-groups-in-west-bank/), who's [charter](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp)says -

It means you are one of 3 things -

1. You don't know what you support - Maybe you get all your info from social media, maybe you are virtue signaling, just looking for quick and easy acceptance, maybe you are just supporting Palestinians because you are just following what your political party of choice supports
2. You are a genocidal person in general - Maybe you understand what you support, but it has nothing to do with Jews, you might be naturally fond of exterminating ethnic groups, do you have to also want all French to be dead? all Germans? maybe all Indians?
3. You are an anti Semite - If you both know that you support the killing of million of Israelis, and you don't happen to be supporting the extermination of any other ethnic group, than sir, you are an anti Semite."

1,2023-08-28,Learning Palestine Arabic - Possible?,u/LYDWAC,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/163rpze/learning_palestine_arabic_possible/,"Good day my dear people,

I've always been fascinated by the Arabic (and Semitic) language(s), the food, the geography, the history etcetera etcera. Also, I've already taken a look into Modern (and Biblical) Hebrew as well as MSA. Well, due to me having not much in common with ""Israel"" besides growing skepticism towards its legitimacy as a just state (not endorsing any kind of violent actions from both sides obv) and finding Hebrew a bit to unattractive as a language (for now), I figured that I should learn Arabic - or at least making me familiar with its structure. I have chosen Palestine/SL-Arabic mainly because of the Netflix show ""Fauda"" which I really enjoyed watching and the Arabic spoken appealed very much to my ears.

The principal problem of mine - as with all language learning projects - are the resources and/or the money to get them. Among you, is there someone who can recommend me a book (or better a free PDF hehe) which is not overly expensive and - much more important - well at explaining (in linguistic detail) the Palestine-Arabic dialect(s)? If there is, might that someone be so kind to recommend it to me?

Thank you."

Some information before I begin: My girlfriend and I are both cis female lesbians, in our mid-late twenties and have been together for a bit over a year. I am jewish, she is not. 

Some background on me, I came out a couple years ago, I'm part of a tight-knit middle eastern jewish community, won't say where to protect Identity. Being gay is not super common in my community but more people have been coming out in the last decade. While they obviously didn't have an easy time with it, my parents are awesome parents who accepted me and didn't push back on me when I came out as lesbian to them. Now for the typical trope, it's been impounded in me my whole life to marry Jewish (what's new). When I was ""Straight"" it was never an option to consider dating someone who wasn't, but as I was realizing things about my sexuality I realized it may be difficult and limiting to make that a condition, and I also became more generally open minded so long as I was respected and felt understood and embraced. Thus far, I've never dated a jew, my 2 girlfriends before my current one were not and I had a series of incidences and moments where I felt disrespected, misunderstood, not embraced etc., emotions that solidified what i've been told on my life, that my life will be better and easier if I am with someone jewish. (FYI: Neither of those relationships ended bc they weren't Jewish, neither of those partners met my parents nor did my parents know about them, since I was closeted still). Anyway, after my last relationship which left me feeling very disrespected and not understood, my rule that I would never date someone who wasn't jewish was born.

My current girlfriend and I met on a dating app but started off very casual with that being the only intention. I had just gotten out of a relationship a month before we had matched, which I was able to get over pretty quickly because it was toxic and long distance. 

I made it clear from the start to my now current gf that I just wanted something casual, and she revealed she was looking for the same. Seemed like a perfect connection between two attractive people wanting something casual with no attachments. I made a concerted effort to uphold an extremely strong boundary so as not to mislead, we never did anything outside of meeting up to have sex. No dinners, no hanging with friends, no casual dates. Nada. But we would text every day, all day. 

As time went on, feelings grew on her end. She'd say things like she could see herself catching feelings and I kept kindly pushing back and reminding her I just got out of a relationship and want to keep it chill which she was receptive to. Eventually, her feelings took over and it was a constant conversation about whether we should continue hooking up or not because she was catching feelings. I had always been kind and receptive, even suggesting we stop and move on out of respect for her feelings. Then came the day she fully admitted she had feelings for me, to which I gave her the spiel and let it be known very kindly, respectfully, and lengthfully: I wanted to date someone who was Jewish. She took it well and had questions all of which I was willing to answer, but that basically changed the scope of our connection and we slowly dwindled from there. Eventually she told me she wanted to stop talking all together and I respected it and we parted ways.

It didn't take long for her to pop back in, admittedly we had an undeniably amazing chemistry and great conversations, but on top of that we became good friends with nice banter and vibed on pretty well. We rekindled agreeing to remain casual again, and then the flip happened. I started realizing in the week we stopped talking that I felt like she was awesome, and I was internally sad I couldn't date her because I made that rule for myself. It felt too late, but long story short, and after a lot of back and fourth, hesitation, conversations, and a slow build, we became exclusive and then started full on dating.

We've had an incredible relationship thus far. We get each other, we're extremely compatible, my parents like her, my friends love her etc. Just one thing: she can't get over the fact that I told her I couldn't date her because she isn't jewish. It is a complex that cannot seem to die out. In any moment she can get triggered or feel super insecure. She says things like ""oh maybe you should be with someone jewish, they'll understand you better,"" ""you wish I  was jewish don't you,"" ""you're going to break up with me one day because i'm not jewish,"" ""you would've enjoyed that more with someone Jewish"" and thousands of different variations of the same comment. We've come close to splitting a few times because she's said she doesn't know how she can get over it. I will sit there for hours or do whatever it takes to validate her, explain why I felt that way at one point and why I don't now, reassure her, etc. and we will be fine, only for it to resurface once more some weeks later. 

I don't know what to do. I'm tired of constantly feeling like shit for the fact that I said that and felt that way at one point. I've taken accountability for how it has devastated her and that it has been hard, but she doesn't understand the mob mentality of the Jewish community or the fact that I felt disrespected for my identity by previous partners which triggered me to not feel safe with someone who isn't moving forward. She always says she ""never feels like enough"" for me and I try to explain that her not being jewish never made her not enough, it just didn't make her compatible to what I thought I needed at one point in time. I'm running out of tools and things to say. It really just makes me feel sad, defeated and depleted at this point and our relationship is truly too beautiful to allow it to succumb to this complex.

TLDR: I once told my girlfriend I couldn't be with her because she wasn't jewish (before she was my gf, we were just hooking up at the time), and now it is an insecurity that doesn't seem to ever go away."

He rips a lion in half, leaves its carcass out in the sun for a week, then finds a beehive growing inside of it and reaches in and starts eating the honey. That's not kosher at all.

Then he married a Philistine woman, which is against the Law as well.

He kills 30 people and abandons his first family because his wife told some people the answer to his terrible riddle. He burns crops, he slaughters thousands, he's basically a terrorist. Even his final act, though it's an act of faith, still kind of just amounts to killing a bunch more people.

In Milton, Samson recognizes his error in wielding strength without wisdom and laments his lack of foresight. Does the Biblical Samson ever come to such a realization? When he prays for Hashem to give him strength, why does Hashem grant that to him in his final moments? Is Samson just a killing tool used by Him to enforce His will? Or is there some kind of worthiness or enlightenment attained during his imprisonment that is rewarded with an answer to Samson's final prayer?"

1,2023-08-29,Illegal Palestinian settlements in the Kurdish city of Afrin(Efrîn),u/Beneficial_Owl_1385,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/164a9z0/illegal_palestinian_settlements_in_the_kurdish/,"Since the Turkish invasion of January 2018, the Kurdish population of Afrin, northwest Syria, has fallen by more than 60 percent, according to a local rights group. 

Thousands of indigenous Kurds were forced to flee the area when Turkish forces and their Syrian militia proxies launched Operation Olive Branch on January 20, 2018.

By the time Ankara had seized control of Afrin city from the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) on March 24, tens of thousands of Kurds had fled, many of them to Kurdish-controlled areas in northeast Syria.

Families displaced by regime offensives to the south were resettled in their place. 

“According to the latest statistics that we received, the size of the indigenous population of Kurds in the Afrin region reached 34.8 percent in January, while they previously made up 97 percent of the population,” the Afrin-based Human Rights Organization said in a report Sunday. 

“The number of arrivals from various other regions makes up 65.2 percent of the population.” 

The organization, which is run by local activists, failed to elaborate on the ethnicity of the settlers, but said they are from Idlib, Ghouta, Homs, and Deir ez-Zor – Arab majority areas. 

It estimates Afrin is now home to 298,700 Kurds and 458,000 people displaced from elsewhere in Syria, while Afrin city is home to 53,300 Kurds and 110,000 people displaced from elsewhere in Syria. 

International aid organizations were barred from entered Afrin following the offensive, making data difficult to verify. The Human Rights Organization did not explain its methodology. 

According to UN estimates, upwards of 150,000 Kurds have been displaced, most of them displaced to Shahba camp in Tel Rifaat, north of Aleppo. 

Turkey launched Operation Olive Branch with the stated aim of pushing the YPG back from its southern border. 

Ankara believes the YPG is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), an armed group which has fought a decades-long war with the Turkish state for greater political and cultural rights for Kurds.

The YPG, which makes up the backbone of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), denies any organic ties with the PKK.

Monitors accused Turkey’s Syrian militia proxies of committing abuses against Afrin civilians, especially Kurds, during and after the offensive.

Photographs quickly emerged of militiamen looting Kurdish homes and businesses and pulling down a statue of Kawa the Blacksmith – a core figure in Kurdish national culture. 

Observers accused the militias of ethnic cleansing after homes were commandeered by fighters, residents intimidated or kidnapped for ransom, and displaced families blocked from returning. 

Judicial structures in occupied Afrin are managed by Turkish-backed armed groups. 

“Security chaos still prevails in the Afrin region, as a result of the spread of armed elements under the Syrian National Army in a chaotic manner, carrying weapons without distinguishing them from thieves and bandits,” the Afrin-based Human Rights Organization said. 

Turkey and its Syrian proxies launched another offensive against Kurdish forces in October 2019, this time in the northeast, after US troops withdrew from the Syria-Turkey border region. 

UN observers accused these Turkish proxies of potential war crimes and allowing an Islamic State (ISIS) revival in areas liberated by the Kurdish-led SDF.

The Russian-backed Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad has demanded Turkey withdraw from its territory. 

Earlier this year, Syrian troops and other regime loyalists clashed with Turkish soldiers in Idlib, where Ankara has established military observation posts and supports the armed opposition. 

A ceasefire deal brokered by Moscow and Ankara appeared to halt the regime offensive to retake the province. Efforts to contain the COVID-19 outbreak also seem to have reigned in the fighting. 



And early recovery efforts do not turn these demographic changes into the status quo,” said Syrians for Truth and Justice (STJ), a human rights organization.

In a report entitled “Housing Settlements in Afrin: Demographic Engineering or IDP Housing Projects?” the STJ added that these settlements could be established to be part of the systematic process of altering the demographic composition of Afrin."

Hey fellow members,

I'm facing a bit of a dilemma and could really use your insights. This weekend, I'm planning to attend Schacharit at the synagogue for the second time. As I wanted to make the occasion special, I decided to purchase a yarmulke on eBay that I thought looked quite nice.

However, here's where things took an unexpected turn. When the yarmulke arrived, I noticed that it's a ""Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman"" yarmulke. Now, I'm in a bit of a quandary. I don't know much about Nachman Meuman except for what I read last night after receiving the yarmulke.

So, here's my question: Would it be appropriate for me to wear this yarmulke to the synagogue for Schacharit? I want to be respectful and mindful of the significance of such symbols. I'm not entirely sure if it's suitable to wear one related to Nachman Meuman without knowing more about it.

I'd truly appreciate any advice, insights, or guidance you can offer. This community has always been incredibly supportive, and I'm hoping you can help shed some light on this for me.

Thank you so much in advance for your help!"

I was scrolling through YouTube when I saw his videos on Israel (from about 2 years ago) when I was disturbed on his last video. 

He seems either dishonest or incredibly uninformed on the conflict and while explaining history, He words it to seem like the Ottomans had the land first and that Jews only live there because of religion and not ethnic or cultural ties. He glorifies Hamas by saying how they are oppressed so they are justified and other disgusting opinions. 

What made me post this was in the comments there was (obviously) people who are spreading propaganda such as the racist and dehumanizing Khazar and “White European” myths and he liked their comments. I saw a few defend Israel and he actually replied by either just immature arrogant insults like “hahaha sure buddy” or downright racism to someone who called him a liar by saying “Of course a guy called Yaniv would think that jajajajajjaJAJAJAJAJAJAJajaja”. I find this incredibly offensive given his open Antisemitic views, dishonesty by not telling the full picture of the conflict and immaturity.

I will link the video in question here and please spread the word on this guy so ignorance won’t prevail. Video: https://youtu.be/D6ZQthyCPAQ?si=Vn2TaPCuzTNgQH0L"

Cell service has been crappy for the last two months. My partner has Golan and my friend has Hot, and they often seem to have service when I don’t. On top of that, frequently it looks like I have service, but practically I have none.

I’ve tried contacting them for help haven’t responded to three attempts via WhatsApp/email. I tried calling their hot line before and they were closed during their listed business hours. Today I tried calling again and they put me on hold for 15 minutes, then logged me for a callback within 9 minutes.

Three hours later I get the call back from them, wait a few minutes for someone in the call center to pick up… and then there is no one on the other end. I hear the background of the call center, with no answers when I’m yelling “is anyone there” in Hebrew.

So, in 5 minutes I called and a witched to Golan - easy peasy .

I’m also a butch lesbian (noticeably enough that I’m mistakenly called Sir on the reg)

All this said, my friend and her family are Reform, very open minded, and have never shied away from my sexuality or asked me to “tone it down” for any family function they’ve invited me to.

For an event as important as this I would normally wear a dark, men’s style suit (Jacket, shirt, tie). And while my friend has said she is fine with that I don’t want to inadvertently cause her or her parents grief by having them have to deal with other members of the extended family or congregation who may not be as open minded.

She is never going to tell me to wear something that makes me uncomfortable, but I also don’t want to be disrespectful in any way.

Any thoughts?"

i was shocked at how much i saw myself in that situation, of course without the loads of money and adam sandier as a dad, but it portrays friendship in perspective of a teenage jewish girl and i connected with it so much. 

my bat mitzvah party was anything but big, and i only had family and few friends attend, but preparing for it felt like the most important thing in the world and it had to be perfect- even when it ended up different. the movie shows the importance of friendship and your connection and understanding of judaism rather than popularity and money. it had its share of struggling to portray gen z and jewish jokes, but i really enjoyed watching it with my family and wanted to share it here too. give it a watch!"

However I just wish I was able to celebrate the Jewish holidays with my family - like we would Christmas I suppose, and like I see a lot of my friends doing with their families. But it’s not their holiday, and I don’t want to force my celebrations onto people that don’t follow them.

I was very upset to find that there are no synagogues in Sicily. At least, no synagogues that pop up with a simple search. Is Judaism in this part of Italy not a thing? Im willing to wait until i return to the US and then find a synagogue where I can properly learn with a Rabbi more about this beautiful religion. I just wish I did not have to wait until then to start. Any recommendations the community might have for me? I meant this post in the most respectful way possible.

These days I am secular. ""Culturally Jewish"". I have a partner \[31F\] who has a complex relationship to judaism. She is not halachically Jewish, but has strong ancestral ties to it. She is currently exploring and defining her relationship with Judaism, and I am supportive of this. She has recently mentioned the idea of converting to me, but is specifically talking about an orthodox conversion. This makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. I have not had an orthodox upbringing, but I have worked in orthodox jewish schools and been amongst the orthodox community enough to know that I live my life a very different way and do not feel at home at all in any way with that community. I'm worried about how incompatible the orthodox way of life is with my own. Worried about the conversion process, and how it will impact our relationship. Worried that she will come out the other side with completely different values. Worried that I will lose her to this. I have always felt that having a jewish partner is a bonus, but not a prerequisite. If she never converted I would be OK with this, or wanted to convert to reformed judaism or something similar. If I was swiping on apps and saw someone jewish who makes it a point to mention in their profile that they keep shabbat, I felt they were ""a bit too Jewish for me"". I feel really conflicted about this whole thing. I will not make any effort to stand in her way if she decides this is the path for her, but I think we may need to part ways for her to peruse it. I really love this girl, but I'm just not sure how this can work. I am absolutely not prepared to start being observant as it is completely at odds with my personal values. I'll drive on shabbat. I'll eat a bit of bacon or have a cheese burger. I'm not interested in attending shul. I don't want to have my lifestyle dictated by judaism. 

I could really use a bit of perspective. Just shouting into the void really. Am I being too harsh in my view of the challenges this would bring to our relationship? Does anyone have any relatable experiences? "

&#x200B;

The term ""lone-wolf"" attacker is misleading because there is definitely an underlying theme in all Palestinian terrorist attacks against Israelis. 

&#x200B;

[Nadav Shragai for Israel Hayom writes](https://www.israelhayom.com/opinions/no-such-thing-as-a-lone-wolf-terrorist-2/): 

The attacks are no lone-wolf incidents – the perpetrators are part of a wolf pack in every possible aspect. The attackers may decide on their own where to strike and they do it on their own, but they drink from the same poisonous well that makes the killing of Jews kosher, be it because ""Al-Aqsa Mosque is being desecrated"" or just in the name of Islam or the Palestinian cause. The incitement and hatred have no organizational affiliation, it runs across the board. It is the common denominator for practically all the ""lone-wolf attackers.""

&#x200B;

The Palestinian street is drunk - but not with wine. It is high on the wild incitement that has become a hotbed for terrorists. The inciters – whether on radio or on television, the print media, or the social networks – should face the same punishment as those holding a gun or any other arm. They and their ilk share indirect responsibility for sending the terrorists and for the atmosphere that made it possible.

&#x200B;

The Palestinian Authority, may be assisting Israel in capturing dozens of killers but it has not lifted a finger in an effort to stop the worshiping of death and martyrdom. It has not stopped the explicit incitement to kill Jews for being Jews. It has allowed the continuation of terrorist glorification; it continues paying families of terrorists and has been memorializing them upon their death. Perceptually, it has been breeding terrorists and helping them grow, while occasionally helping Israel detain them in extreme cases."

In November I will be taking a trip to Israel. Although I will spend most of my time in Jerusalem, I am hoping to take a bus to Tiberias and then renting a car there to spend a few days in the Galilee. However, I have a question about my plans in Tiberias.

I would like to do a day-trip driving from Tiberias to Tel Megiddo and then, from there, driving to Caesarea before returning to Tiberias at night. Would this be possible to do in a day? Maybe spending 2 hours in Tel Megiddo and then a couple in Caesarea?

Moreover, when checking the route from Tiberias to Tel Megiddo on Google maps, it says ""this route has restricted usage access or private roads"". The same happens when I check the route from Tel Megiddo to Caesarea. Is it possible to drive to these destinations in a rented car?

1) my grandma from my mom’s side uses words from Yiddish slang
2) many of her ancestors have german/jewish last names but she told me they were not german plus some of them actually came from jewish villages. But im really not sure if they are actually jewish because most of them were christian. 
3) my grandma on my dad’s side owned so many jewish books (like jewish anecdotes and so on)
4) we put little rocks on my family’s gravestone because my aunt told me it’s a jewish tradition

Case in point arabs in israel, who are the same people as those in gaza and majority of those in the west bank don’t commit terror attacks at nowhere near the same rate.

Yes it does happen like in May 2021 but it generally only happens during wars with gaza, outside of that it’s mostly peaceful from my understanding most of the crime that does happen from arabs in israel happens against other arabs. 

Therefore do you think if the economic situation improved there could be a way towards a solution? There isn’t any wall separating arabs in israel to stop terror attacks but I think a lot of this has to do with poverty as well as the occupation, because if it was culture or religion why don’t arabs in israel do it? I still don’t think a solution will possible for a while but I think it will likely end in a confederation of some kind."

I am talking, 5 years old. Many people who grow old and are without children have said the same thing. I do wonder why I always FELT this way because this seems to be such a frowned upon decision- I wonder if I was just made this way. At the same time, there are a long long long list of logical and fair reasons as to why one would NEVER want to go through that. Things that are so not talked about, especially in our community- but behind the curtain of this thing we call a miracle, are terrible things that happen to almost every woman during and after they are pregnant. I am a nurse. I am a very empathetic, sensitive person and I actually LOVE children, but I KNOW it is not for me and I would not be the most fit parent. The hard part is, I have always dreamed about getting married :) Silly, but here I am in my 20s now and wanting so badly to date but bursting into tears when I really think about all the stress that is ahead. I am so afraid of being single for a long time. I don't know how to even go about this cause our community barely talks about it. All I know is, there must be more jewish people out there who feel the same but don't speak about it.

How am I even going to date? On the apps? What else? I am also a private person and don't want to announce it on my apps for the whole community to see, but when I start dating it will be a shame cause I know one man will probably spread the word to others. It is my business, it is so personal, and a lot of people at least in my community... TALK. And having to tell my parents... I just don't want to have kids and ruin them out of peer pressure of what others want. this is my life after all and I deserve to be HAPPY and content. I am feeling so depressed over this and I pray to Hashem that I will be able to marry someone within my religion. I hope I can meet them in my 20s. I want to grow through life with someone, I don't want to wait years for that.

Anyways, I have a few question about what to do after making Aliyah. Nefesh B’nefesh does an excellent job of making Israel seem like a fairy tale, when I know that’s far from the truth. I really like Israel from what I’ve seen and have physically explored communities I think I’d like to live in. Personally I’m not really that religious and I guess my level of Zionism would be average?

Ashkelon, Ashdod, and Erfat are my my top 3 choices. 

My questions are simple, I think, but stress me out. 

-What cell phone providers should I look at?

-What banks should I look at? I’ve heard Mizrachi is not a good one?

-How do adults in their 30s make friends? Maybe at Ulpan?

-How do I keep myself from getting scammed until I fully learn the language?

-Is it a hard process to buy a car? 

I feel like I cannot go to my Aliyah advisor for certain everyday questions. I’m hoping for a mix of different answers so it makes me even more anxious.

I was really struck by how people described the boundaries. Yet there are areas where these different communities can overlap. Or maybe where the beliefs and practices of some members of these communities overlap with other branches of Judaism. 

So how are Jews who do not practice all the tenets of their own community considered and treated? What is the difference between a non-observant Jew who is a member of an orthodox or conservative community and a Reform Jew?

This is actually a question mostly for non-Reform Jews. Reform Jews do not question the Jewishness of other Jews. I should say generally they don’t. I’m sure there are some instances where this has happened. But one of the central premises of Reform Judaism is to tolerate differences in degrees of observance. 

I remember a joke my dad told me. A Jewish man was stranded on an island. When he was rescued, he proudly showed his rescuers around what he built and how he survived. He pointed to a building and said that’s my house. He pointed to another building and said that’s my shul. One of the rescues asked what’s that building over there? The shipwrecked man said ‘that synagogue?- I wouldn’t set foot in there if they paid me!’ A kernel of truth wrapped in humor."

I’m wondering which appliances are worth shopping with my moving container, as if I remember correctly appliances are expensive there.

A couple of years back I got:

• Sony TV - 55"" Class A8H Series OLED 4K UHD
• Apple TV for the above
• Vitamix Ascent A-3500 (powerful blender)
• Cuisinart 7 Cup Food Processor, 600-Watt Motor, White, DLC-10SYP1 (small one)
• Countertop dishwasher EdgeStar - it’s simple/cheap but I love it, and the place I’ll be first has no dishwasher, I’m a little OCD lol.

Should I ship all of the above with my stuff? Of course it goes by square meters so I don’t want to take stuff that is not worth it due to voltage issues, or get too expensive. I will prob have toshav chozer benefits. 

Do I need one step-down converter 1500 for each? How does it work, and would it work? If so - are they expensive in Israel, and should I get them here?

Anything else I should maybe buy now that’s crazy expensive in Israel? - not large stuff, more on small appliances side or so.

Also do Apple devices bought in the US - can they be charged in Israel with no converters? - can someone confirm?

There's lots to be positive about. 

But the services really make me cringe. They are awful. I hate the guitars, keyboards, microphones. I hate that the cantor sings facing the congregation like I'm at a middle school recital. I hate the pews. 

Part of what I love about being Jewish is that I'm not a Christian that has to perform my religion in a church-concert. Why can't Reform shuls bring it back down to earth and have services that are not modeled on church services?

I love how orthodox services don't demand my full attention-- I can say hello to people as they come in, I can take my time through prayers that I find really relevant to me. It's beautiful when people are davening different parts of the service and it feels so much more authentic and less produced. I love kids running around the shul and people coming in and out. In Reform shuls I feel like I have to stand at attention and be exactly where the cantor is. It's really distracting and overbearing. 

I feel like one shift I've noticed is that Jews want their Jewishness to be distinct from American WASPness, and I think the way Reform services are is a huge turn off to young people because it emulates a lot of WASPy traditions. I'd much rather step into a synagogue and feel like I'm in another culture, a place that transcends place/time, because to me that's a huge part of Judaism-- 5000+ years of being apart and being distinct. 

I know some people will say ""ok then go to an Orthodox shul""...but as I mentioned at the beginning, reform shuls do many things right, and they serve an important part of the community. I think their services are the weakest part of what they offer and I think they are out of touch with the experience people would respond to."

Seeking advice.

Hey everyone,

I'm up late tonight due to some ongoing challenges my wife is facing, and I could really use your thoughts for comfort, inspiration, or just some perspective.

Background Info: I was raised in the US and come from a modern orthodox background, while my wife, whom I met overseas during my military duty, is in the process of converting to Judaism. She's an incredibly intelligent and empathetic person who chose this journey because of her own deep interest in philosophy and her search for a spiritual connection that resonates with her.

Here's the issue: My mother, who was raised orthodox in Israel, and I have been fortunate to connect with a wonderful Chabad Rabbi and his wife while I was in highschool. I joined the military out of highschool and was sent overseas for a while. When I got orders back to the United States, I proposed to my wife and brought her back with me. The Rabbi and his wife from my hometown, and my Mom were supportive of my wife's decision to convert. They even reached out to a Chabad in my current area to ensure her conversion process would continue smoothly.

Initially, the Chabad Rabbi local to my duty station provided my wife with a roadmap, including literature, weekly classes, and immersion in the community, however, his dedication has been less than expected. Despite his apparent enthusiasm in the beginning, he isn't familiar with the materials he recommended, ignored my wife's request for one on one sessions, and has even expressed a reluctance to help those who aren't in close proximity to the Chabad house to others while we were in earshot (the Chabad house was purchased in one of the most expensive and least walkable neighborhoods).

As she approaches her ten month mark in the US, my wife's progress has been entirely self-driven, based on her own reading and attendance at services. The lack of support and guidance from our local Rabbi is disheartening and leaves me questioning his commitment to the promises made to my hometown Rabbi and my mother.

I understand that conversion is a rigorous process designed to ensure true commitment, but I can't shake the feeling that the support we were promised isn't being fulfilled. This came to a head as my wife and I were driving home Saturday night after staying at the Chabad house this past Shabbat. On the way home, my wife broke down sobbing, saying that everything about this process feels wrong. She understands conversion is supposed to be challenging, but she shouldn't be made to feel like she has to constantly beg and badger for help from someone who actively goes out of their way to be unhelpful. I have to agree. We have been asked for time, energy, and money from this Rabbi, but he refuses to give anything in return. 

I don't know what to do besides support her with her studies and emotionally, because this has to be her process, but I'm getting mad. I'm scared that because of his willful lack of effort, my wife will eventually give up hope.

*Amplifying information:
- We stay over the Chabad house (or a hotel within walking distance) once a month for shabbat, and try to have a couple our age over once a month for shabbat. When we go back to my home state, we walk to the Chabad with my Mom and sister.
- We attend holidays at the local Chabad house or my hometown Chabad so long as I am not on an out state training exercise.
- My wife majored in philosophy and was interested in Judaism well before she met me. She has never had a strong relationship with the religion she was born into.
- One of the major stressors of this situation is children. My wife knows that if we have kids before her conversion, they won't be considered Jewish in most circles, so she has made a personal commitment to wait. The longer this is dragged out, the longer we have to wait.
- It is important to my Mom that my wife's conversion be recognized in Israel, hence the orthodox conversion. I will respect her wishes.
- My Mom has reached out to my local Rabbi on multiple separate occasions, asking him why he hasn't begun one on one sessions with my wife, and each time he promises to start. Each time I follow up with him, he makes excuses or says he has to think things over.


Any insights, advice, or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated."

1,2023-08-30,"On the Legal Status of Transjordan and the Partition, 1920-24",u/Matar_Kubileya,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/16571i0/on_the_legal_status_of_transjordan_and_the/,"Recently, I encountered a chain of discussion regarding the decision by the British government to separate the Transjordan from the Mandate, and specifically discussing a) what the legal relationship was of Transjordan to the remainder of the Mandate prior to its separation, and b) whether or not the interpretation that the separation was illegal--implied by Jabotinsky and his ilk--is, if not correct, rigorous enough that we need not impute dishonesty or incompetence to it. That discussion is easy enough to find on my profile if anyone is interested, and due to the several posters involved I see no reason to repeat it here. At the same time, the research I did in answering the question rapidly spiralled, and I decided it might be a good idea to copy it as a top-level post to facilitate further discussion as I have done in the past in similar cases.

Article 25 of the actual text of the Mandate as approved by the League of Nations clearly states that the boundaries of the Mandate for Palestine included the Transjordan, while providing caveats for special administration:

>In the territories lying between the Jordan and the eastern boundary of  Palestine as ultimately determined, the Mandatory shall be entitled,  with the consent of the Council of the League of Nations, to postpone or  withhold application of such provisions of this mandate as he may  consider inapplicable to the existing local conditions, and to make such  provision for the administration of the territories as he may consider  suitable to those conditions, provided that no action shall be taken  which is inconsistent with the provisions of Articles 15, 16 and 18.

There was no generally recognized and legally enforced eastern border of the Mandatory territory prior to the integration of the Transjordan; while the initial Sykes-Picot agreement had only included the northern half of Judea, Samaria, and parts of the Galillee, the Zionist Organization pushed for a boundary including the eastern bank of the Jordan as well as a northern border centered on approximately the Litanni. The latter issue was resolved with the First Paulet-Newcombe agreement that, aside from the Golan, established the modern northern border of Israel with Syria and Lebanon, but the Western border was not firmly decided prior to the formal implementation of the Mandate.

In spite of the initial agreement between the British and French at the San Remo Conference and the--informal--promises of the British representatives in the Transjordan (informal in that the relevant persons were never actually empowered by HMG to make the promises they made), the Transjordan was effectively completely annexed into Mandatory Palestine as a matter of law with the establishment of the Mandate, with certain extraordinary rights granted to the British within that region, albeit ones that the British almost immediately put into motion.

As a \*fait accompli\* in the present day and age, there's zero reason to relitigate the Jordan partition as an actual matter of territorial ambition in the present day. At the same time, however, there are deep questions as to the legality, under the terms of the Mandate, of the British decision to fully partition the Mandate: arguably, the decision to effectively vacate part, but not all, of the Mandate exceeded the authority of HMG to ""postpone or withhold application of such provisions of this mandate as  he may consider inapplicable to the existing local conditions, and to  make such provision for the administration of the territories as he may  consider suitable to those conditions"", as the recognition of a not merely \*autonomous\* but \*independent\* government in Amman and to remove the territory from the internationally recognized Mandate effectively constituted a breach of the rights and duties of the Mandatory power. In this line of reasoning, in short, Britain could allow for a permanent \*autonomy\* in the Transjordan, but it could not totally remove it from the general boundaries and purpose of the Mandate.

As it were, no groups other than the Revisionists seriously challenged the Jordan River partition, and even they were a) relatively marginal at the time and b) more inclined to arguing against it on political and historic, rather than legal, grounds. The question of whether an act of dubious liceity that never faces a formal legal challenge until it is accepted as \*fait accompli\* is a legal one is a matter of abstract jurisprudence beyond the scope of this forum. Nonetheless, we should not imagine that the restrictions on Britain's power within the mandate were legally toothless, as the later case of the White Paper of 1939 shows. Quoting from Appendix IV, ""Palestine: the Historical Background"", of the Report of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry:

>The Jews unanimously condemned the 1939 White Paper as a violation of the Mandate,  which would place the Jews in a permanent minority status in a hostile  Arab state. Jewish violence broke out in Palestine, and Jewish  organizations throughout the world issued the most vigorous protests.  The Arab leaders, too, rejected the White Paper  at first on the ground that it denied them immediate independence.  Soon, however, the Nashashibi faction agreed to cooperate with the  Government in giving effect to its terms, and as time passed the  majority of Arabs came to accept it as fulfilling, if properly  implemented, their main demands.    
>  
>Despite the hostile reception given the White Paper,  and in face of vigorous attacks upon it in Parliament, the British Government succeeded in securing Parliamentary approval of their policy and presented it for consideration by the Permanent Mandates Commission. The Commission unanimously held that the White Paper  was in conflict with the interpretation which the Mandatory Government,  with the concurrence of the organs of the League, had put upon the  mandate in the past. Four of the members felt that the policy was not in  harmony with the terms of the Mandate,  while the other three held that existing circumstances would justify  the policy provided the Council of the League of Nations did not oppose  it.    
>  
>The Government thereupon prepared to lay its plans before the council  in September, 1939, but the outbreak of the Second World War resulted  in the suspension of League of Nations activities, and no final decision  on Palestine policy was reached.

While not directly connected to the administration of Transjordan, this report \*does\* show that as a matter of international law the actions of the British were in principle subject to a fairly high degree of scrutiny by the international community even when operating within the \*prima facie\* authorities expressed by the Mandate. Inasmuch as I am able to find, the Permanent Mandates Commission--while never giving a firm ruling on the legality of the British action--expressed no small disapproval of the implementation of the British partition in their Report on the Fifth (Extraordinary) Session of the Commission, dating to 1924, available [here](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/mandate-for-palestine-report-on-the-work-of-the-fifth-extraordinary-session-of-the-commission/):

>The Commission expressed the hope that it will in future receive fuller information regarding the administration of Transjordania. Although, in virtue of Article 25 of the Mandate and of a decision of the Council dated September 16th, 1922, not all the articles of the Palestine Mandate are applicable to this territory, the Commission points out that the latter is nevertheless under \\\[the\\\] British Mandate and that consequently the mandatory Power should make an annual report upon its administration.    
>  
>The accredited Representative of the mandatory Power stated that his Government would not fail next year to submit to the Council a special report on the administration of Transjordania.

I cannot find any of the subsequent reports online, and judging by the state of the relevant sections of the UN's archive website I think it unlikely that they have been properly digitized. Someone who is more familiar than I with the archive system of the UN may have more luck than I have, but inasmuch as I am presently able I am able to find neither specific approval nor specific disapproval of the decision to separate Transjordan. Nonetheless, in my reading the above report suggests that the Commission looked skeptically on the British decision to wholly separate the region.

To be quite clear, there is no reason to seriously debate the legitimacy of modern Jordan on the basis of a nebulous and incomplete  discussion of a League of Nations committee from a hundred years ago.  Nor is it to say the Revisionists' claims were ethically or politically  sound, I and many other Zionists then and now consider them to have been  irresponsibly Quixotic at best, and unjust and provocative at worst. At  the same time, the claim that the Transjordan was never included in the  territory of the Mandate, and likewise the corollary that the  Revisionists were utterly irrational or dishonest in their  interpretation, does not stand up to the scrutiny of the historical  record.

Reading about the community it was the smallest in Britain and closed and reopened a number of times in the 1800’s, and I’m finding very little information about the Great Yarmouth or Kings Lynn communities. I’m wondering if anyone has any information on these communities or how to find this information?

2. The belief in G‑d's absolute and unparalleled unity.

3. The belief in [G‑d](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/433240/jewish/God.htm)'s non-corporeality, nor that He will be affected by any physical occurrences, such as movement, or rest, or dwelling.

4. The belief in G‑d's eternity.

5. The imperative to worship G‑d exclusively and no foreign false gods.

6. The belief that G‑d communicates with man through prophecy.

7. The belief in the primacy of the prophecy of Moses our teacher.

8. The belief in the divine origin of the Torah.

9. The belief in the immutability of the Torah.

My understanding of the Reform position on this is that there was not a literal revelation of the Torah at Sinai, but simply a “divine inspiration.” What does that mean?

My attitude is that G-d cannot “inspire” a human to write something unless he specifically said something to them which provides inspiration. If so, that implies that Hashem gave them some sort of instruction which they were apparently given permission to twist for their own ends.

If the real meaning is that G-d did not appear and did not give any instructions, that contradicts the official Reform position of the existence of a personal deity who is involved in the world."

By ‘interesting,’ I mean our introduction to the Holocaust was literally *The Boy in the Stripped Pyjamas* back in fourth grade.

Personally, I think ten years old is a little too early for a crisis of faith. My teacher didn’t seem to agree, because in either fourth or fifth grade, my class was subjected to this movie about a boy who drowns in the Dead Sea or something of that sort. His parents are Orthodox, but his death makes them question God’s existence and the entire movie is basically about them dealing with grief and reconnecting with their faith. 

The movie is in Hebrew, set in Israel and had this weird blue-ish cast. It would’ve been released somewhere between the mid-90s or early-2000s, possibly earlier, but no later than 2006. This is all I remember, because the experience was frankly so traumatic I had to speak about it with my therapist. I was a weird child that got reoccurring nightmares from a ketchup commercial though, so I don’t know if it’s really that bad. Which is why I want to see it again. I need to know. I *must* find out.

So any useful Intel on why I should make an RH get together would be appreciated, especially since I always felt the year began on Passover anyway, so why celebrate with another meal in honor of another new year? I'm thinking we are celebrating/anticipating the time when all the world will celebrate the new year at this time in Messianic times?

At least according to Amnon Abramovich, this isn't about the judicial revolution - which apparently Elron objects to - but mainly due to a personal beef he has with prospective President of the Court Amit. Still, this could play into Levin's hands; if he's even seriously considered, it would crack the support for the seniority system. Besides that, Elron is risking bringing his own probity into question. Hayut removed him from the Judicial Selection Committee case, but there are several cases to do with the judicial revolution and he's still on at least one of them (the Reasonability clause case, which has a full panel). If he rules in favor of the government position, he'll forever be dogged with acusations that he did so in order to curry favor so as to be selected."

I am still a minor and until a few months ago I never even knew any of the stereotypes that jewish people face. I was uninformed back then, of course knowing about the holocaust and the key historical events concerning judaism but it never really seemed as something special about someone. It was as unnecessary to me as someone telling me their favorite animal, I just accept the person the way they are. 
However lately, ive got sent a link from a person i know from years ago and as I opened it, I felt very shocked.
The site was listing up founders of hollywood studios, basketball team owners, nobel prize winners, chess winners and many billionaires claiming that every aspect of that is owned or dominated by jews. 

I had a very bad feeling in my stomach and after searching up some of the mentioned people's religion like anthony blinken or mark zuckerberg it actually turned out that they were really of jewish origin.

After seeing a study from pew research center confirming that american jews earn more money than the national average i started stressing over myself.

I felt really anxious, not knowing on whats going on until i stumbled across a jewish person who made a video explaining why jews are in average more successful with money and that it's a thing deeply enbedded into jewish culture.

He listed many points, such as value of education, urbanization, money lending being the only thing they could do during medieval times etc. and I was glad to find a non anti semetic, rational explanation to the matter.

Despite that, i feel somewhat, as if people never told me the other side of the story. For years I always thought, jews are economically oppressed and i thought the community probably suffers a lot from homelessness or very low wage.

While I know that anti semitism is on the rise and that Jews sure have it harder than other groups of people, I just never knew that so many jews are economically better off than most americans (I know there are dozens of poor jews, im talking about the average).

I don't know why, but the new information i got since a few weeks kind of stays in my head and makes me overthink. Am I a bad person? Am I going to offend someone? Is this Anti Semetic?
Maybe its just my teenage mentality of overthinking but I thought maybe you guys can now tell me if I should feel guilty and if so, what can I do for making myself a good person again. 
I dont want to feel like a bigot.

Practicing divination is forbidden in our 613 mitzvot.

According to the Ari Hakadosh, tools like Tarot are not to be messed with because you could connect with realms and entities other than Hashem through them.

However Tarot symbolism is derived from and has a relationship with Kabbalah and some Tzaddikim have been known to use them. Some modern day observant jews use them and it doesn’t seem to be considered avera as much as just unwise to use.

I imagine this varies from community to community.

I have questions as someone who wouldn’t classify myself as frum, but definitely am more observant than lots of jews I know irl. So I’m sort of maybe in the middle. I’d like to be more frum (though I probably will never call myself that bc I’m way too critical of myself :P) eventually. 

So I don’t particularly love denominations of judaism because I don’t fully align with any of them tbh. So I just call myself Jewish and go to the only synagogue that’s within a reasonable distance from me (~35-45 minutes). *technically* my synagogue is reform, but it used to be conservative. So we just vibe. 

But here are some of my questions:
- why does there seem to be so much dislike/disapproval of people who aren’t as frum, but are definitely observant to some degree. Ex. Someone doesn’t totally keep kosher, but they pray three times a day or vice versa. Someone literally never misses services, but doesn’t follow certain rules like shomer negiah or family purity (like not touching a partner on their period until they’ve gone to the mikvah). 
- To add to that, what are frum communities (in your experience) opinions on people who work their way up to being frum? Like, they don’t pray three times a day, they pray once a day. And then eventually they work up to three times a day because they can’t realistically commit to three times a day at first (this is me right now) Or they “work up” to keeping kosher (gradually add more kosher laws into their life until they finally are keeping kosher fully)

The reason Im asking is because on a few threads lately i’ve seen people saying that orthodox (and hasidic and heredi, etc) think that more “liberal” (conservative/reform/etc) groups don’t *really* practice judaism. And I’m just wondering if it’s really that black and white. I don’t live near a community with a larger, cohesive frum group. We are a very mixed bag and I’m mostly just curious. TIA!

(also—i tried to word everything without offending anyone. if I f’ed up just let me know. Text is not always my strong suit 🫡)"

But that seems more like a cultural tradition than rooted in halakha?

Asking because I think it would be nice to grow a little potted citron tree."
