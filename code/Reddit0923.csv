Apart from actual violent incidents I can just list

Trump is hitler 
Qanon January 6th mess
Ron Desantis recently using a nazi symbol in a promo video
BHI and NOI rhetoric pervading cities 
College campus rhetoric
Far right far left blech
Being blamed for Covid 
And all the stupid shit in congress in both parties along with many others and obviously the whole Kanye thing though I refuse to let that person influence my life.
Jeffrey Epstein is a time traveling Jewish Weinstein crime ring space wizard Rothschild stuff
Linda Sarsour



List just goes on and on really , obviously the open and anonymous antisemites online and holding events and just Neo Nazi apologists or deniers in the Republican Party 
On top of that the just general huge dispersion of conspiracy media online, which always seems to inevitably lead to -us/

Plus all the Ashkenazi - Eurocentric perceptions. 
Luckily my family mostly came to america in the 1920s apart from a few that fled the holocaust to live in Australia for a while, but like I don’t have any family in Europe lol how am I not entitled to my own opinion on eurocentric culture in america. 

It honestly is a bit stunning to see how many people can be radicalized by media indoctrination- has for sure given a whole new perception of how this persists in peoples minds beyond the good old put you in an oven jokes people would make in highschool. 

While also having the whole Ben Shapiro -Bernie sanders who gets to call themselves Jewish divide

List goes on and on really haha. 

Might need some Aliyah time just to be on the other side of things, as an artist I always wanted to connect with creatives in Tel Aviv but my general tendency being I guess left of center but non Marxist just made me feel like I’d be ostracized by politically active BDS types where I live—- 

Lol every other minority gets to celebrate their indigenous roots and decolonize their lives except us, not that every Jew isn’t entitled to their own opinions but a lot of them I’ve seen be kind of almost acknowledging their need to assimilate when it was the exact opposite of that which preserved Our lives up until now. 

On top of that just realizing that the international rhetoric on our ethnic heritage is constant and also constantly profitable for other people. 

Like we’re almost on the verge of a national debate on the measurements of our skulls 

🙃

It’s definitely just been draining and I’d like to get the fuck out of this country for some time"

Made aliyah this year and have been living in Israel consecutively the last year. I just recently though started working a job where I am exposed to LOTS of American tourists. This opens me up to having a lot of conversations with these people. Most of them are super sweet and kind, also Jewish. BUT on occasion I'm noticing that there are a lot of christians and I'm noticing the conversations I've had with them are becoming increasingly aggressive. 

On a few occasions now I've been roped into conversations that make me feel wildly uncomfortable and comments have been made to me that are indeed antisemitic. The other day this woman pulled me into this conversation right as I was trying to end my shift. The anti-christ, the new world order, marxism, the ""truth"", price haggling, how liberals destroyed California, etc... were her talking points to me. She thought she could say all this and did so because she thought I wasn't Jewish and when I informed her I was she tried to deflect and play all sweet with me. I tried my best not to get mean but I haven't a clue how to shut this down quicker. I usually avoid these types of people really well in the real world (I used to live in the US regional south so it was a common practice to try and stay clear of these types) but dealing with it here feels like a different story. 

Has anyone else dealt with this type of behavior and rhetoric? If so, what do you think is the best way to shut them down?"

Anyway, a friend of a staffer there told me that their new rabbi says and does inappropriate things that make the staffer uncomfortable. These behaviors are unprofessional and illustrate a man who has no sense of boundaries or appropriateness.

I’m feeling glad I pulled my teenage daughter out of the program. However there’s plenty more women and girls who come in and out of there. When I left a lot of women told me I was the only person who’d ever listened to them and they were incredibly sorry I was leaving.

I feel icky about this. I don't think he's doing it to try to convert me, or anything like that. I believe him that this comes from a place of genuine concern for me as a fellow human. But it does feel strange. Why even ask me? I'd never know if he just prayed for me and never said anything. I don't like the feeling of being involved in this, and I can't help but wonder if he's thinking of me for this partially due to my Jewishness.

On the other hand, I don't believe that prayer does anything. If the only effect of it is that he feels like he's done something loving for a fellow human, why should that be a problem?

For various reasons, I've fasted some years and I haven't fasted others, but it occurs to me that, in the years I didn't fast - regardless of whether the reasons were related to mental illness, medical issues, etc. - I've always felt guilty and ashamed. I didn't feel comfortable sharing with others my choice to not fast, and I always felt great pressure to fast, even if I knew it wasn't in my best interest. (I grew up, and am still part of, an American Reform congregation, BTW.)

So I'm wondering: How do you all feel about fasting? Do you feel pressure to fast, even when you don't think it's a good idea? And if you don't fast, do you feel guilty?

Also, perhaps this doesn't need to be said, but I'm not looking for arguments as to why or when Jews should or shouldn't fast. I'm specifically looking to understand whether others experience guilt/shame/pressure surrounding the Yom Kippur fast."

The geopolitical landscape is changing. The cards are being reshuffled. Rogue nations like China, Russia, and Iran are ascendant. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Brazil are beginning to deal in Chinese yuans. The Third World is no longer the West's playground. China is neo-colonizing in much of the Eastern Hemisphere with it's Belt and Road initiative and debt trap diplomacy. Based on their treatment of the Uyghurs, they're not particularly interested in protecting the rights of minority religious or ethnic groups.

Within the West, instability continues to grow. From the George Floyd riots, to the January 6th storming of the Capitol, to the Canadian trucker convoy blockade of Ottawa, to the recent riots across France, we are witnessing a steady escalation of unrest. If this continues, you will no longer be able to rely on the current cabal of Western elites to ensure your safety. Tremors of anti-Semitism can already be felt, like with Kanye West or more recently Jamie Foxx. It appears that, within the next couple decades, pogroms could become a very real possibility in some parts of the world.

It is an open secret that Jews have a disproportionate amount of influence in Western politics, media, finance etc... and in general, Jews tend to use this influence to promote progressive politics in Western countries. The fact of the matter is that the West can't hope to compete with China or maintain stability if we are arguing about things as silly as gender pronouns and the like.

Now on to the deal. I will be negotiating on behalf of all Western traditionalists.

Here are the terms: We will restore stability and deter China and other ""rogue"" nations. This may entail things that you would perceive as ""sexism,"" ""racism,"" ""homophobia"" etc... In return, you will no longer interfere with Western politics, media, or finance. If you honor the terms, the Chosen Ones will remain blameless. However, if you break the terms, then everything goes up in flames and we burn together.. What do you say?"

(google-translate should do a good enough job of translating it, and it will probably be published soon in 972Magazine in English. If anyone has any issues with the translation regarding the text I'm more than happy to help)

Here's a google-translate of a short summary of the story by the editor of the website, Meron Rapoport:

&#x200B;

>About two months ago, social networks were scorched by a document showing military forces sealing an agricultural well with concrete in the south of Mount Hebron. It is the combination of the intense heat, the arid region and the violence of the act of plugging a well that probably garnered millions of views. To explain what was described by quite a few Israelis as a ""media terrorism"", the army stated that ""four illegal water wells were sealed that were drilled in violation of the interim agreement, harm the natural water supplies and constitute a potential for aquifer contamination"".  
>  
>That is, according to the army's statement, the plugging of the wells was done for a noble purpose: maintaining the supply of groundwater and protecting it from contamination. But a detailed investigation conducted by Matan Golan breaks down this message into its elements, and presents it in its true light: a poor excuse designed to cover up the brutality with which Israel manages the water sector in the West Bank. A water policy that leaves millions of Palestinians thirsty on a regular basis, floods the settlers with excess water, and neglects the neglect that criminalizes the groundwater and exposes it to pollution, which endangers not only the Palestinians and Israelis living in the West Bank, but also the residents of the coastal plain.  
>  
>Here are some of the data: only 36% of Palestinians in the West Bank receive a regular supply of running water; The average daily Palestinian consumption in 2020 was about 82.4 liters per person, below the average of 100 liters per person recommended by the United Nations World Health Organization; in the isolated Palestinian pastoral communities, such as the community whose well was blocked, the figure is only about 26 liters per person per day , is similar to the consumption data in disaster areas. All this while the water consumption in Israel is three times higher, and the consumption in the hilltop settlements is six times higher.  
>  
>By virtue of its control over Area C, Israel prevents the deployment of pipelines that would connect the water-rich areas to the hot areas of the West Bank, and does not allow new wells to be drilled. The Palestinian thirst, the investigation shows, enriches Israel. The Palestinians purchase a third of their water consumption from Israel for hundreds of millions of dollars.  
>  
>At the same time - the investigation reveals, relying on reports from the State Comptroller, the Nature and Parks Authority, the United Nations and Palestinian research institutes - Israel is negligent in protecting the groundwater in the West Bank. Most of the army camps are not connected to sewage infrastructure, polluting factories have been set up in industrial areas in the settlements, the wastewater treatment plants serving the settlements operate partially, and Palestinian wastewater treatment projects are not approved. The result is a dangerous increase in the levels of pollution in the streams and wells of the West Bank, and a growing threat to water sources inside Israel.  
>  
>And all of these things, all of the vulnerabilities in the environment and sustainability, Israel covers with the worst kind of blind eye when it claims that a small water well in an arid area in the south of the Hebron mountain, is the one that will dry up the bank and pollute its groundwater. This argument, writes Golan, does not hold water.

Since I was a kid I believed in a lot of Jewish beliefs without always knowing they were Jewish. Somethings I felt inside me, and somethings from my grandmother. 

I looked into my genealogy after my paternal grandmother passed, and learned she was Jewish by blood, but never told my father. I wasn’t sure if she knew until a few years later after my aunt passed and I looked through my aunt’s poetry book to find Jewish prayers, and some prayers she wrote of her own with Jewish ideologies.

I eventually I got help from a Jewish family friend who recommended a local synagogue. I went to services, and worked toward converting. A few months ago I put my studies, and meetings with my rabbi on hold as I had a lot of sick family members I wanted to make time for. 

Now here I am planning to spend Rosh Hashanah with my atheist uncle, and christian cousins. I still pray, keep kosher, and will be bringing candles with me.

Judaism has always felt right in my heart, and soul. It’s what I believe, and I feel that they are my people. When someone asks me why I do, or don’t eat certain things, or asks about any other behaviors due to my beliefs I simply say I’m Jewish. If a Jewish person were to ask I explain my situation. My semetic friends say that they already consider me Jewish since I practice more than them or most of their family. 

I’m not Jewish by my culture/up bringing, I’m not Jewish from my maternal heritage, and religiously I haven’t finished converting. The only part of me that is Jewish is my beliefs, so what am I? I don’t feel like goyim, but I fell like saying that I am a jew is dishonest, or disrespectful."

They slowed the car, stuck their head out the window and repeated “Hey Jew, wanna cook?”. They sped off before I could say anything. A few bystanders saw but said nothing.

So, my birthday is Sunday. I won't be celebrating because I have a mountain of work to catch up on. I'm just going out for dinner with my mom, which is fine. My dad texted me today asking if I'm free on the evening of the 15th. You bet your sweet tuchas I'm not. Here's a little rundown of how that went:

Me: ""Yes I have plans that night. Why?""
Him: ""Would you like to come to a bday dinner for you three?"" (referring to me and the twins, who have their birthday a few days after mine)
Me: ""I have to think about it. That's the first night of Rosh Hashana. I missed it last year and was planning on going.""
Him: ""Can you let me know soon?""

Well, by now I'm pissed. He also said that no other dates would work due to everyone's schedules conflicting. I get it, we're all working adults and planning get-togethers is hard. But the 15th, really? Last week I sent him a picture of all the upcoming High Holy Days, just so he'd be aware. Now they all went ahead and made plans to have a belated birthday dinner, but conveniently forgot to *ask me* if that day worked. 

I'm struggling with this. I didn't get to attend services last year, and my rabbi has already set aside a ticket for me to attend (everyone else has to pay, but she's letting me slide since I'm not officially Jewish yet). On the other hand, it would be kinda nice to have a group birthday celebration. Even though I *really* do not like my dad's girlfriend, I get along well with her kids. If I choose to go, it's not to spite them. I don't even know if I feel comfortable saying ""my faith is more important than time spent with family."" If only they could plan this dinner on another day, which...they can't. Honestly, I'd like to socialize and hang out with them, but it feels like I should place my faith first. I don't want my rabbi to think I've changed my mind about being on this path. I barely attend services due to transportation issues, but I was determined to attend all the High Holy Days.

It's worth mentioning that my dad and his girlfriend do not take my Judaism journey seriously. At all. They're both devout Christians. He's made it clear that he ""doesn't understand"" why I'm on this path. And I wonder if maybe that's why he didn't care about planning it on Rosh Hashana? Because he definitely knew about it, since I'd told him about it last week.

AITA if I decide to go to the synagogue over a birthday dinner? There's a lot more I could say about how he's prioritized her kids over me ever since they got together, but that's a can of worms not worth opening."

Just ask yourselves these questions:

1. Did I assume my position in favour of Israel/Palestine after assuming my position as a rightist/leftist?

2. If the answer to the first question is ""Yes"", did I assume my position in favour of Israel/Palestine in the context of rightist/leftist propaganda or as a result of a research of my own?

3. Do I feel ""isolated"", so to speak, within my side of the political spectrum when it comes about the ISR-PAL question?

My personal answers (feel free to share yours and to add other questions):

1. Yes (I'm a center-leftist social democrat from Spain).

2. No (I actually did a research of my own).

3. Yes (most Spanish leftists are against Israel, but I am pro-Israel)."

I was raised a Christian and he a Muslim but we had, even as children, always questioned our beliefs (much to the outrage of our families) but we both believe in a god and we both noticed the oppressive nature of our religions in our lives (the absolute shutting down of any questions or discussions about religion being a major factor and we had questions, for example on my behalf, how could Jesus be the messiah if he didn’t fulfil the vital tasks he was supposed to fulfil as the messiah which is a huge deal to me because the answer to this question is that obviously he cannot be the messiah, something that crumbled my beliefs in Christianity. Anyway, cutting this long story short - because my partner and I had religious beliefs forced on us we want to raise our children to make up their own minds. We also didn’t have them circumcised for the same reason. I’ve spoken to several Jewish people who’ve said we are good candidates for conversion but that our sons not being circumcised is a big issue and they would need it done. However one is a teen and one is 10 and I already know they would never do it. Would this really affect our ability to convert? And if it did, could we still be Jewish without the formality and community - just in our own way at home the best we can? Thanks for reading and I look forward to reading your replies."

I am a dual citizen who grew up in the US and has very little Hebrew comprehension and I'll be living with my dad who is a kibbutznik now living in the north in a small town (25,000 people). 

Last time I was in Israel was in 2012 and the average secular Israeli was very abrupt about how my beard needed to go. I was profiled by the authorities because admittedly, my photo made me look like a terrorist. I think at the time ISIS (Daesh) was on the rise regionally and may have played a role in the anti beard feelings. I also realize there is tension between the religious communities and secular people and this has mostly increased since then. 

My beard is well trimmed, clean and groomed now. I also have really long hair I mostly wear in a ponytail pulled through my hat. Am I setting myself up for strangers to get mad about my fuzziness? Will women laugh and men point and also laugh? I think I look good but the fact is I'm just lazy. It's a non issue here in US, it's obvious I'm not a right winger with my long feminine hair. 

Do I cut it all off or leave it? I want there to be good impressions in my dad's town since I'll be there for a while and its not that big. 

Thanks for any advice! General advice is also welcome. I plan to learn Hebrew as fast as I can for the record."

I'm so so so tired of seeing Muslims and Jewish people argue with each other as a Muslim myself. The Prophet (peace be upon him) felt no hatred towards Jewish people. Some Muslims take verses referring to Prophet Muhammad's PBUH struggle with three rebellious Jewish tribes to justify prejudice, which I despise. By taking these verses out of context the message of the Qur'an is very distorted and does NOT reflect the attitude of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) who felt no hostility towards Judaism. 

""Do not argue with the followers of earlier revelation otherwise than in a most kindly manner—unless it be such of them as are bent on evil-doing—and say: ""We believe in that which has been bestowed from on high upon us, as well as that which has been bestowed upon you;for our God and your God is one and the same, and it is unto Him that we [all] surrender ourselves"" -Quran 29:46

1,2023-09-02,Why I oppose the two state solution,u/c9joe,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/168aa5i/why_i_oppose_the_two_state_solution/,"It's very practical reason, Israel's geography. The proposed state of Palestine would have much land in Judea and Samaria. This region is very hilly. The majority of Israel's population is on the coastal plain. A belligerent Palestine would be able to shoot missiles or even cheap shells into Israel and hit big targets. They do this from Gaza, but it's actually quite challenging and expensive to strike Tel Aviv. This would not be so from many of these hilltops.

If you ever been in the region around the Jordan river, you see this: it is a massive valley, a lot of the terrain is very rocky too, and even has a giant salt lake just to make invasion extra hard. There is these big mountains in Jordan and big mountains in Israel on both sides of this valley. This terrain is a natural barrier. It is hard to invade Israel from this.

Missiles to Tel Aviv would have to clear all these mountains and land correctly, which means they have to have stability features and lots of fuel, which makes them expensive. A belligerent country past this valley could not do so much damage to Israel without a much higher economic and human cost.

One could say, Palestine will not be belligerent. But I doubt this is the case. Besides the national culture and ideology being very aggressive to Israel, they will have little in natural resources or economy, which will naturally make them even more aggressive. Think of the situation in Gaza, but with a much bigger country.

Israel can prevent this two state outcome simply by the status quo. With the status quo, a highly fertile Jewish population is building and expanding settlements in this region and turning it from an Arab region to a Jewish and Hebrew region. This is very noticeable and is happening at a much greater scale than most people think IMO. The Arabs are living in these little villages that are like islands in this region and have no influence on the arteries or even the Jordan Valley, which seem to me to be less Arab than Israel proper.

Further there is not much pressure to change the status quo internationally, and the world, and the West (who is the biggest pressure maker) has too many problems of their own to deal with, to virtue signal a bad utopian solution onto Israel. So this international pressure is unlikely to ever come.

There really isn't much more to why I think a two state is a bad idea. It's not so much because of religious Zionism, or some kind of right wing expansionist ideology. It is just better for Israel's future that Israel's border is the Jordan Valley."

I hope it is okay to ask this question here. Please let me know if it is not and I will remove it. Thank you!

Question: Will you feel weird as a Jewish person, if you see a Black lady attending Jewish events? I know most of these events are exclusive and for Jewish people, but I am interested in Jewish culture and like it, and the people as well.

Truthfully, my ex was a Jewish guy and after him, I don't know if I'll be able to date non-Jewish men again. He made me feel so loved, seen, and heard, literally everything I ever wanted and prayed for. Unfortunately, it didn't work out because of one issue, and I had to let him go and we parted ways amicably. I have tried dating, but the guys just seem meh. I've been searching for that feeling with other guys, but they just don't measure up. Inconsistency, cheap, can't communicate well, can't even hold a conversation, not genuine, etc. I'm just focusing on myself and living my life now.

That said- I want to start attending events and joining activities because a lot of my hobbies are solo and I am very happy doing stuff alone, but I want to meet new people. I was just wondering if you would think it's weird if you see a Black lady in a space for Jewish people.

Thanks in advance for your responses!

Edit: Thanks for your responses! About the dating Jewish guy comments, here is my response to some of the concerns:

I should have worded my post differently as that is not the only reason. My ex introduced me to Jewish culture and I liked it and have been reading a lot of books and learning more about it. I like the culture, and the people, and want to be closer to it.  I want to learn more about the culture, and If I meet a Jewish guy in the process, wonderful! If not, that's wonderful, too. 

I live in a city with a large Jewish population, so I know the chances are high. I am considering conversion, but not sure. I just want to attend a synagogue service and see how I like it. I didn't mean to make anyone uncomfortable. My apologies! It is not my intention to make anyone uncomfortable or fetishize anyone because I know fully well what that feels like. I sincerely apologize."

Now I agree that 31 is still people who died, but still it's not that much. It most certainly doesn't justify full scale military operations and blockading whole Palestinian cities and disrupting their daily life.   
And if you watch the Israeli media, they make it look like as if Israelis are being murdered almost on a daily basis, which is obviously not true.

I hear this argument that it's because Palestiniane was not a sovereign nation.
The fact that the west didn't consider Palestiniane a country is irrelevant. Actually in my opinion if we consider the situation where there really was no Palestiniane but a large populated area which the Jews started immigrating into, it is still wrong for those Jews to establish a country in a land not owned by them which other people still live in, and it's very logical for the natives to disagree."

I'm having a reform conversion. I really like reform judaism. I feel like its a really fun and wholesome community. I go to shabbat services every week and do minyon when I can.

Overall, I feel like it is a significantly important part of my life and I think ideally, I want to marry someone within the community. It's just, I'm kinda worried because I don't know how many other people feel the same way about the reform movement as I do.

Like, most of the active people at my congregation are significantly older than me. I'm quite young(20s) and it seems like jews my age either just aren't reform or if they are, don't really care much about religion. My reform friends who are my age, as well as their parents, didn't even date/marry other jews.

Anyways, I'm not really looking to date anyone exactly at this moment. But when I am, I just hope it isn't as hard as I think it might be."

Something like that can be done with the Maccabees, too

But in general religious folks today are very cemented in their fantasy world and secular folks are (unnecessarily) dismissive of our history so Israeli art ranges from parochial to Western with very little in between. I feel that a shared national mythos is sorely needed and artists are needed for that.

We are the heirs of a civilization that

\- was very advanced for its time compared to most of the world (I mean in the IX-VII centuries b.c.e.), not the most advanced one (that title goes to Egypt and Mesopotamia) but way ahead of other parts of the Mediterranean, having widespread literacy, advanced tooling, an alphabetic script, some philosophy

\- managed to do an impressing engineering feat in order to excavate the Shiloah tunnel

\- was documented: between Ishayahu, Shebanaiah, Hezekiah, Oshea, Sanherib, Tiglat-Pileser, Sargon, Ahaz, Yotam... we can see some of the people from different points of view, as narrated by different documents

And don't get me started on the end of the Second temple period, on the Maccabee revolt, the Jewish diaspora... We have haYehudim Baim but it has become a joke. I think there is the material to make a ton of movies and TV series on the history of this land from a ""Hebrew"" point of view, not a religious one."

1) How important are the key moral principles in your life? (And are these principles more important to Orthodox Jews than to Liberal/Reform Jews?)

2) I've found it hard to find simple summaries of the moral principles (Tzedakah & Chesed) - here's what I've found so far (is this correct?):

Tzedakah (Justice):

* Obligatory

* Giving of money (10%)

* Own family, local charities & Jewish causes take priority ('nearest first')

Chesed:

* Voluntary

* Not necessarily money (can be money, time, kindness)

* Individual actions (in contrast to tzedakah, which can be individual/communal)

He was visiting and a bit uptight. He's from Israel and didn't speak English. I offered him a chocolate edible and I explained what it was (via google translator)in Hebrew. He was hesitant but took it, blessed it and ate it.  It achieved the desired affect but I'm feeling guilty about it now. Can someone help me understand if I violated any religious rules for conservative Jews?"

Copying verbatim what I wrote:

**When I go to the kotel on Shabbat,** I notice some charedim don't go under the metal detector and instead enter via the exit turnstyle (which doesn't turn, so they have to nudge their way through the little gap). This is making me quite nervous about the **""shabbat mode""** of the the metal detector, which every time I ask, I'm assured is turned ""off."" **Is this operating under some kind of heter** or similar mechanism as a ""kosher light switch""? Can someone please explain this? I wouldn't use a ""kosher light switch"" either, so if it's a similar situation I would rather not go through this way (+ please don't judge me for my observances...I understand how the kosher light switch works, it's just not something I'm personally comfortable with—I know people can be a bit judgy here!).

I’m curious about your views on either, if you’ve heard or read a good deal of his work. 

Not to be too restrictive, but I’m not really interested on a quick opinion based on a hasty search of who he is or what the podcast is about, but only if you’ve really heard a good deal of his “stuff” and feel like you can give a solid assessment. Or if you know of a website that’s given such a review from a Jewish perspective, that would also be very helpful. 

Thanks so much!

Note: I’m a Christian. (In case that needs to be noted.)"

Advice on Playing a Jewish Character in D&D 5e,u/SomethingAboutaCrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/1692hm5/rabbi_cleric_advice_on_playing_a_jewish_character/,"I'm an avid D&D player and for my group's next campaign, which is set in a sort of fantastical uchronic late Medieval Europe. I've decided to play a cleric, and look to my own heritage for inspiration rather than going with the stereotypical Christian-style cleric. 

To be clear, I don't care much about pure historical and religious accuracy. This is a fantasy escapism with friends, I don't intend to stress over minutia. I just want to explore a cool concept and have some stronger representation for my culture (because yeah, we existed in Medieval Europe and I'm sick of fantasy media leaving us out). I'd like your advice on how I can make my portrayal as respectful and true to the *spirit*, not the letter, of medieval Judaism as possible. My family isn't religious, I never went to Hebrew school, so my background in the Talmud is pretty limited and I'd like some advice.

My character is an Ashkenazi Yeshiva student from a school with a focus on combatting the demons, vampires, and other such fun beasties threatening the mortal world. The classic D&D cleric gets their powers essentially from pure faith. However, Judaism puts a lot less emphasis on belief than Christianity, and a stronger emphasis on knowledge. I'm wondering how I might reflavor some of my clerical abilities to better represent a Jewish background. Like, where does my magic come from? Is there a unique way I cast spells? Are there any spells I should take or avoid? Should I cast with intelligence instead of wisdom? Is me failing Divine Intervention just loosing an argument with God?  


I'm also curious what would be a respectful way to translate traditional Jewish clothing into a fantasy world. I want my character to be visibly Jewish, but I don't want to appropriate Orthodox dress in an offensive way, or use any pieces of identifying dress that were forced on us by sumptuary laws. "

I know some orthodox jews are agonist Israel due to religious reasons, that Israel should only exist when Messiahs returns (or something like that). But why don’t these jews move away from Israel then? And aren’t they afraid the muslims will just kill them, oppress them or drive them away if Israel would stop existing? 

To me this is as crazy as when LGBTQ people defend islam. Basically chickens protesting for KFC.

I am new to the sub and really hope my questions will be useful not just for me. The questions are eternal in a sense that I saw similar posts before but the answers did not really suit me, so I try to bring the specifics.

About me and my family, just for the context and to address possible clarification questions: 

We are the family of 2 and 2 dogs, we are young (31m and 28f) and plan children at some point but that is not the top priority at the moment. Our Hebrew level is basic but we are learning it and do not plan to avoid it (I also studied it 20 years ago but didn't have much practice). We speak English, Russian, and Ukrainian (I also know some Spanish but it is very basic). We can work remotely, so the only must is a good Internet connection and comfortable working place (co-working can work too). I am not sure I know the exact budget but it's approximately 15,000 NIS after taxes. We like boardgames, social life (I used to dance social dances, I also love opera and theatre. I also don't drink, I hope it's not a problem for making connections), and hiking. We are not very religious but follow the basics if it makes sense.

So, with basics out of the way, the questions:

1. Where to live?  Things that are important: the places to go with the dogs (we have golden retrievers), if possible near the sea AND forests/parks (but if I must to choose, I'd probably prefer greenery). I have far relatives in Ashkelon but I'd rather not live there - want a bit of freedom, as my childhood memories provide the images of not very good neighborhood.
2. Are there any communities to join/follow? Just to not create a social vacuum around us? As I mentioned, we are fine working and resting by ourselves but a touch of social life (of both olims and natives) could be nice.

As I started the post I had an impression I had more questions but I guess I answered some of them as I searched for the information in this sub or while trying to write this post.

Anyway, thank you in advance and please feel free to ask any additional questions!"

My partner saw that the song names were in Italian and said “why is the title Hebrew but the songs aren’t?” or something along those lines. Being a bit of a nitpicker I said “mazel tov is Yiddish, if it was Hebrew it would be spelled m-a-z-a-l tov” to which they replied that it it was Hebrew it would be spelled with the Hebrew aleph-bet and I said “you know what I mean.” The conversation ended there.

This morning I was listening to the album and remembered our conversation from last night, so I decided to prove them wrong cause why not and found a reliable source saying mazal tov is the Hebrew pronunciation and mazel tov is Yiddish, but they said “the pronunciation is different but it’s the same word.” I told them pronunciation correlates to spelling. Who’s correct here? I’m pretty sure it’s me but I wanna be sure before I continue any further. I know it’s a silly argument but still"

Although God knows everything, Jews can “convince” God and be intimate with him in every way. Fearing him but not like a fear of hell type of way, a fatherly reverence a child would have. The theological ability to question and talk to the all sovereign God is very revolutionary in modern religions. Is there any stories we get this understanding from? My guess is Jacob wrestling with the mysterious man? Maybe Job? My fundamentalist Christian upbringing sort of traumatized me into thinking doubting and questioning God/Bible was wrong but learning how rabbis debated and talked about God for hours was so beautiful to me, it shows they are serious about God and infatuated with the idea of him, and they are trying their hardest with critical thinking to understand the all mighty God. Thank you guys.

Bonus: why does Judaism say G-d? Is it out of reverence?"

Write me a song about the pilpul niggun.

Output:

In the depths of ancient wisdom, a melody did dwell, A Pilpul Niggun, a tale only the wise could tell, With words that danced like fireflies, in scholars' minds it rang, A timeless tune of questions, where intellect did hang.

In Yeshivot and study halls, where minds would intertwine, The Pilpul Niggun echoed, a symphony divine, It started with a question, a spark in rabbi's eye, A debate, a heated dialogue, as time began to fly.

The melodies of arguments, in intricate refrain, Like twirling dervishes, they spun, a dance of joy and pain, With logic, wit, and brilliance, they wove a tapestry, Of Talmudic interpretation, a profound mystery.

They pondered and they probed, seeking truth in every word, The Pilpul Niggun's cadence, like the songs of ancient birds, They turned each stone, examined, the Torah's sacred verse, In a ceaseless quest for meaning, their hearts and minds immersed.

With every note, a nuance, with every tone, a twist, The Pilpul Niggun's power, in every rabbi's fist, It resonated through the ages, a chorus of the wise, A testament to the beauty found in questions that arise.

For in the Pilpul Niggun, a symphony of thought, The rabbis found their purpose, the wisdom they had sought, It sang of endless learning, of truths yet to be found, In the Pilpul Niggun's melodies, knowledge did abound.

So let us cherish this legacy, this timeless Niggun's grace, The Pilpul's intellectual dance, in every sacred place, For in the questions we explore, the answers may unfurl, And in the Pilpul Niggun's tune, we find the wisdom of the world."

I went to a Jewish day school until I was 11. They held a Shabbat service every Friday, since it was just a school and not a synagogue and wasn’t open on Saturdays.

My mom converted to Judaism when she married my dad, but after they got divorced, I slowly stopped participating as much. I was also no longer going to a Jewish school. I never had a Bat Mitzvah. I have social anxiety, and the idea of having to chant Torah in front of people and being expected to have a party scared me. 

I don’t have a good relationship with my dad, and he himself doesn’t have a great relationship with his family. So it has been a while since I’ve been invited to family functions for holidays. 

But anyway, I miss being involved in Judaism. I’m not religious in that I would consider myself agnostic. But certain rituals are familiar and comforting to me. I like the sense of community I feel in a synagogue, and the connection I feel to my ancestors. I know common prayers by heart.

There’s a Reform synagogue near me. I was never a member of it and I’ve only ever been to services there a few times as a kid, but my sister went to preschool there.

Would it be strange if I just…showed up for Saturday morning services? I am not a member and have not paid anything; I don’t know if this would be considered rude or frowned upon. If I were to end up going frequently, I would probably feel obligated to become an official member of the congregation."

Ever since I converted back in February I’ve been wearing my Kippah everyday and the main reason being it made “feel” Jewish.
Recently though I’ve been lacking a bit in my observance and I feel like I should stop wearing it until I get back on track. I think it’s also important to mention that I am gay and I occasionally wear eyeliner and maybe some mascara so yeah when people see me wearing a black kippah its like they’re taken a back.
My point is I feel kinda guilty not wearing it now. I can wear my Star of David without a problem it’s just my conscious messing with me. 
Any advice 😅?"

So my MIL, who is a Korean American Christian, barely apropropros to the conversation said something along the lines of ""I don't really understand why someome would be Jewish since they killed Jesus""

My jaw dropped. I didn't want to create friction, in Korean culture I am expected to have quite a lot of respect and deference to my mother-in-law so this was delicate. I said something along the lines of ""that's not something you say in polite company"" (which I realize is completely inadequate )and I tried to say it in a way that wasn't too reproachful (like an awww shucks sing songy voice). My wife (who is athiest), seemingly completely missing the import of the out-of-contrxt statment from her mom, and not really knowing the historical import of the deicide narrative to boot, then asked me something along the lines of ""why? Isn't that who killed him in the story?"" (she wasn't defending it, it was just a naive question). I explained that, yes, the story taking place in Israel, of course some Jews were involved in those events, but that framing has a lot of history that motivated Jews being murdered.

It was a Sunday afternoon birthday lunch, so I just dropped it there. But I'm really bothered by it. 

Koreans has never any significant Jewish population, so this isn't some deep rooted anti-semitism coming from Korea---it's coming from church stuff. I think its just a naive view she's picked up.

My wife is all into social justice with no attachment to any Christian theology o I feel like I'll be able to clear it up for her pretty easily. But how the hell am I going to broach this with my mother in law? I am starting to wonder if maybe it explains why she's been so stand-offish with my parents .

Growing up, I never enjoyed praying - I just did not find meaning in it. Once I grew up and moved out on my own, I still participated in Jewish activities (ex. Moishe House events, seder with friends, etc.) but I stopped going to synagogue because I didn't enjoy it. To be honest, I don't miss going to synagogue - I still do not find meaning in prayer. I find meaning in the cultural celebrations with friends and family, so those are the things I continue.

With the High Holidays coming up, I know my parents will be asking which synagogue I am buying tickets at.  Truth be told, I don't want to go to services. I would rather have a meal with friends, or go on a walk alone and think about how I've wronged people in the past year. I know the truth would disappoint my family - they tell me to go to synagogue, if nothing else, just to be around my community. But I just don't want to sit through a prayer service, it feels dishonest to my atheist beliefs. 

So my question.. can one be Jewish without attending synagogue? Bonus points for anyone advising how to get parents to accept your choices on this matter..."

1,2023-09-04,My herpes story - Modern Orthodox,u/Karlburner2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/169ezn6/my_herpes_story_modern_orthodox/," 

**Having grown up in the modern Orthodox community and valuing the opinions of my friends and family, I have noticed a lack of stories about herpes within the community, coupled with an abundance of stigma surrounding it. Although premarital sex is discouraged in modern Orthodoxy, it is not uncommon. There is a need for more education about STDs to assist individuals and couples dealing with herpes or other STDs, as well as to help destigmatize STDs in general. Here is my own story on the topic, in the hopes of contributing to the discourse and helping others who may be going through a similar experience.**

**My ex-girlfriend and I were both raised modern Orthodox. While she had drifted away from observance, she still celebrated the high holidays, had a strong cultural connection, and kept a kosher home. I also strayed from my religious observance but outwardly kept up appearances for my friends and family. Despite this, we shared overlapping values and still aspired to be part of the Jewish community.**

**I was deeply in love with my ex-girlfriend; she possessed most of the qualities I wanted in a partner. While I most likely would have lost my virginity in my next serious relationship, our strong connection made me feel more comfortable doing so sooner than I would have anticipated. A few weeks after we became sexually active, she tested positive for both HSV1&2. Someone more knowledgeable on herpes/STDs may have handled the situation better. I panicked, mainly worried about myself but still feeling compassion for her new reality. My ex was supportive of my decision to abstain from romantic relations until we knew more and for me to accept the risks, but I betrayed her by excessively researching the virus instead of seeking professional advice and having open conversations with her about how to deal with herpes as a couple. Despite my love and desire to build a future with her, I found myself obsessing over our slight differences in our visions for building a future home.Fearing our relationship wouldn't last due to our differences, I withdrew physically. The thought of having to explain to my friends and family our lack of religiosity or the stigma of herpes to a new partner of a modern Orthodox background terrified me. These fears ultimately led me to break off the relationship.**

**Looking back, I realize that speaking with professionals and friends sooner would have helped me overcome the stigma of herpes sooner and allowed me to continue the relationship without unnecessary fear. We would've had the time to make the necessary compromises for a relationship to progress, without the mental block that all the research created for me. I should have been less concerned with how others viewed me religiously, focused on what I wanted from religion, and been more accepting of myself without worrying about how others perceived me. There are rarely second chances to try again in a relationship after the fact, so it's essential to do the hard work of making it work in the present as there is no room for procrastination. The stigma of herpes is exaggerated, easily manageable, and people can be understanding if given a chance. Everyone is more than a virus or illness they may have. If they can't love you unconditionally, they are limiting their capacity to love. Above all, don't make assumptions about how your friends and family will react. Ask them the hard questions and give everyone a chance to better understand.**

**I share my story to highlight that there are countless stories of people living with herpes in modern Orthodox communities, and support and understanding can be found if you are brave enough to ask.**"

I understand that your not going to prevent all Palestinian attacks. Its just not going to happen however I still have some expectation that lessons would be learned and processes would be improved after each attack. The main issue for me is that each attack showed the same root vulnerability and nothing is done to address it. Every single attacker has had a permit to be there. Whether it be a work permit or a humanitarian one. I remember one of the attackers was even there to be treated for cancer. Its like phising. All your security doesnt matter if your just going to give out your password anyway. We either have a problem with intelligence, where we are giving permits to the wrong people, or a general policy problem where too many are given out. In either case nothing has been done to address the issue.

We can even trace the recent eritrean brawl to the same root vulnerability. They were given permits which shows the same lack of intelligence and threat assessment. To make matters worse it does not seem like any of them have actually been punished. I would expect Ben Gvir to at least call for everyone who did property damage to be denied asylum and deported."

The subject of the Sabbath was discussed this morning. This talk was mostly about the need for rest and taking a day off. He went on to discuss Jews take Saturday off, and we (Christian) take Sunday off. I thought this was an odd statement because there are a lot of Christian churches who have programs, services and activities both Saturday and Sunday. In my opinion, this is not a day of rest. If anyone has gone through going to church with kids, getting them ready, making sure they stay clean ect, this is not a day off lol.

I was warmly greeted by the rebbetzin who gave me a tour of the memorial. It was a very pleasant experience, and I felt excited visiting my first synagogue. The first thing that I noticed when I called to enter was her New York accent (I'm from the American Southwest). She was very helpful and informative. I went back to the synagogue and waited for her. As I was walking through the hallway I noticed the Ark. I wanted to go inside and see the space. I asked if I could get a tour and she happily agreed.

She started explaining a few basic things (which I already knew from my own studying and research). She then pointed at the tallit and asked me if I knew what they were. I misspoke and told her those were teffilin. She corrected me and I said something about them containing the shema. She was surprised and I told her that I had been studying Judaism. I asked her a few questions, but looking back at it she was preparing for an event and looked busy. Yet she was so patient.

As I left she gave me a calendar and told me ""Here's a Jewish calendar so you can learn more about Judaism.""

I was so thankful to have had this experience. I have been interested in Judaism and have researched a few things here and there. I finally saw many of the things I researched about in person. She showed me the teffilin, the tallit, and different sefers. I really want to go back and speak with the rabbi. I am interested in attending a Jewish service to see what it is like.

Now, I'm not interested in becoming Jewish. I herd Chabad doesn't sponser that. However, at this point I am what you would consider a Noahide. Would it be a wise thing to contact the local Chabad center and ask them to learn more about Judaism? I am honestly curious. Noahides are very lonely, they have no community.

From what others have told me Chabad does not spend their time on goyim, they would rather spend their efforts reaching out to Jews. I do not want to bother them."

We moved away for a few years but have now moved back with our kids. Now that we are back, I'm finding it tougher to feel accepted and to find my place within the culture. I understand and accept the lack of assistance from the government compared to those that make Aliyah. But I also find that I do not have much in common with those that made Aliyah because they moved here because of their ties to there religion/heritage. I feel like an outsider to even the outsider's here. 

I'm learning the language and trying my best to fit in but finding it pretty difficult. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to integrate in the culture? I know there aren't many of us (non-jew immigrants) that are here but is there any type of support group? Any guidance or advice from veterans is appreciated!"

1,2023-09-04,My herpes story - Modern Orthodox,u/Karlburner2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/169ri1t/my_herpes_story_modern_orthodox/,"**Growing up in the modern Orthodox community and valuing the opinions of my friends and family, I have observed a lack of stories about herpes within the community, coupled with an abundance of stigma surrounding it. Although premarital sex is discouraged in modern Orthodoxy, it is not uncommon. There is a need for more education about STDs to assist individuals and couples dealing with herpes or other STDs, as well as to help destigmatize STDs in general. Here is my own story on the topic, in the hopes of contributing to the discourse and helping others who may be going through a similar experience.**

**My ex-girlfriend and I were both raised modern Orthodox. While she had drifted away from observance, she still celebrated the high holidays, had a strong cultural connection, and kept a kosher home. I also strayed from my religious observance but outwardly kept up appearances for my friends and family. Despite this, we shared overlapping values and still aspired to be part of the Jewish community.**

**I was deeply in love with my ex-girlfriend; she possessed most of the qualities I wanted in a partner. While I most likely would have lost my virginity in my next serious relationship, our strong connection made me feel more comfortable doing so sooner than I would have anticipated. A few weeks after we became sexually active, she tested positive for both HSV1&2. Someone more knowledgeable on herpes/STDs may have handled the situation better. I panicked, mainly worried about myself but still feeling compassion for her new reality. My ex was supportive of my decision to abstain from romantic relations until we knew more and for me to accept the risks, but I betrayed her by excessively researching the virus instead of seeking professional advice and having open conversations with her about how to deal with herpes as a couple. Despite my love and desire to build a future together, I found myself obsessing over the slight differences in our visions for a future together. Fearing our relationship wouldn't last due to our differences, I withdrew physically. The thought of having to explain to my friends and family our lack of religiosity or the stigma of herpes to a new partner of a modern Orthodox background terrified me. These fears ultimately led me to break off our relationship.**

**In hindsight, I realize that speaking with professionals and friends sooner would have helped me overcome the stigma of herpes sooner and allowed our relationship to continue without unnecessary fear. We would've had the time to make the necessary compromises for a relationship to progress, without the mental block that all the research created for me. I should have been less concerned with how others viewed me religiously, focused on what I wanted from religion, and been more accepting of myself without worrying about how others perceived me. In relationships, there are rarely second chances after the fact, so it's essential to put in the hard work to make it work in the present; there's no room for procrastination. The stigma of herpes is exaggerated, easily manageable, and people can be understanding if given a chance. Everyone is more than a virus or illness they may have. If they can't love you unconditionally, they are limiting their capacity to love. Above all, don't make assumptions about how your friends and family will react; ask them the hard questions and give everyone a chance to better understand.**

**I share my story to highlight that there are countless stories of people living with herpes in modern Orthodox communities, and support and understanding can be found if you are brave enough to ask.**"

It's a worldview, it's members wear uniforms (ranging from black hatter's to simple white shirts and black pants, and others), and it's definitely a label. Are there communities of observant Jews who completely are uninterested and turned off by the entire concept of ""Orthodox Judaism""? I feel so turned off by the idea of being part of a community that wears uniforms, but it seems that the vast majority of observant Jews actually enjoy this style of life. 

Does anyone else have experience with these concepts?

1,2023-09-04,"In your opinion, do you feel that European countries should offer some kind of law of return or return preferences to Ashkenazim?",u/c040921,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/169uby5/in_your_opinion_do_you_feel_that_european/,"
Portugal/Spain already gave Sephardim some preference in the residence (Spain) and citizenship (Portugal) process, but that was for a few years and eventually became restricted.  Most countries worldwide (and nearly all European countries) already have citizenship-by-descent, however those processes do not generally take into account ethnic Jews (i.e. only Portugal/Spain did so to some extent, meanwhile Germany/Austria had specific rules on descendents of anyone who was oppressed within their borders regardless of Jewish or not).  In practicality, Portugal was essentially the only country (worldwide) besides Israel to offer some kind of law of return for Jews, even though Israel's law is for all Jews while Portugal's law was for Jews with some lineage back to the Portuguese Sephardic community specifically.

This question is for the rest of the European countries.  Ashkenazim are one of the few pan-European ethnicities.  

The general public associates WW2 Germany with Anti-Semitism.  However, Anti-Semitism has a long history there (as it does in many places that have had Jews there for a long time).  As with North American indigenous ethnicities (i.e. regarding the many tribes that compose what is now termed 'Native Americans'), the fight to recognize a history of oppression and suffering was able to make progress after considerations were given to those indigenous to the Americas.  In comparison, there are also different sub-ethnicities of Ashkenazim, but the Ashkenazim as a group are more similar to each other (genetically, culturally, etc) than to the non-Jewish populations that they were historically adjacent to.  That's why this question is specifically on opinions about European countries generally, due to how Ashkenazim were almost like their own community within historical Europe regardless of borders.  Also, due to oppressions and family desires to forget those oppressions, many Ashkenazi Jews full family trees were lost to history, making it difficult to say exactly which specific modern country a family came from beyond a few generations.

Some people may feel that the WW2 genocide of Jews is too painful and bitter to even consider this, and that is a valid opinion.  There are also valid opinions about Anti-Semitism being present in most places that have Jews, and that access into EU countries provides the largest continuous block of 1st-world countries from which to choose to live in (if safety is your main decision factor).  Jews have historically had presence in many places world-wide and the Jewish community as a whole (and recently in particular, Israel) has benefited from this vast network to call upon.

This is not a question about whether this could be implemented, this is just your opinion of should or shouldn't.  This is also not a question about whether Israel is a better option, this is about Europe."

And the reason why people hate adl is becauae they use their anti jewish hate and make it ""anyone that criticise Israel or call some Jews criminals and killers they will be jailed or censored"". 

But, when i checked the hastag, it turns some actual Nazis support the hashtag and use it to attack the American jews.

So my question is the all people behind the hashtag racist or some of them wants to support Palestine?"

Arafat continued the mufti's legacy by recruiting Nazis and neo-Nazis for Fatah and the PLO. In 1969, the PLO recruited two former Nazi instructors, Erich Altern, a leader of the Gestapo's Jewish affairs section, and Willy Berner, who was an SS officer in the Mauthausen extermination camp.25 Another former Nazi, Johann Schuller, was found supplying arms to Fatah. Belgian Jean Tireault, secretary of the neo-Nazi organization La Nation Européenne, also went on the Fatah payroll. Another Belgian, neo-Nazi Karl van der Put, recruited volunteers for the PLO. During the 1970s, German neo-Nazi Otto Albrecht was arrested in West Germany with PLO identity papers after the PLO had given him $1.2 million to buy weapons."

""in August of this year, al-Qabun‘s 88 residents were expelled from their homes by militant squatters. In May 2023, the 200 inhabitants of Ein Samia took apart their own houses and fled relentless squatter attacks. Last year in July, the 100 residents of Ras al-Tin had been forced out. in 2019, two Palestinian clans were expelled from the area near the Taybeh Junction.
  

  
So what Gennez said is perfectly accurate. Moreover, the rate of ethnic cleansing, illegal Israeli squatting, and squatter violence against the indigenous is accelerating under the current extremist Israeli government.
  

  
The four examples Ziv gave are, moreover, not at all the end of the story. The Israeli High Court is permitting the israeli army to expel the 1,000 residents of the hamlets that make up Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military arbitrarily designated a “fire zone.” Three days ago the army confiscated several civilian automobiles, leaving the population with no way to shop for groceries, as a further step in the expulsion."""

In the three decades that Britain governed the holy land, Arab and Jewish terrorists did everything in their power to try and kick out British troops from there on the basis of race.  


""We will establish an independent Arab state, hopefully to be united with Syria soon"" Said the Arabs.  


""We will establish an independent Jewish state, even maybe with lands east of the Jordan river which belong to British allies"" Said the jews.  


Despite the challenges the British faced, we didn't let the legacy of the **62,000** British soldiers who sought to save the Levant - and the middle east as a whole - from Ottoman Turkish imperialism go to waste. In spite of Jews and Arabs doing nothing but spitting in the faces of their liberators, in WW2 we lost tens of thousands of troops to defend against the possible capture of Palestine. We allow Jewish settlement, protect Jews from Germans in WW2 yet they still spit in our face. We limit Jewish immigration, Arabs still fight against us in the late 40s after partition because they aren't satisfied. Jews and Arabs were so adamant on 'independence' just as the rest of the African colonies turned failed states were, and ended up massacring each other, the end result being murder, ethnic cleansing, and forced multiculturalism. We tried to foster what would today be called a one state solution, but Jews gave that up in order to pursue murderous terrorism while Arabs gave that up in order to get ethnically cleansed and buy themselves a few more costly wars in the decades to come.  


I won't blackpill though, because sooner or later if the middle east wants to survive they're gonna need to suck up to a wide range of Germanic peoples.

I do not believe in afterlife but believe in a God, those are the main reasons as to why I'm interested in knowing more about the sadduccees.

1: Is it possible to be a sadduccee nowadays?

The priests obviously disappeared long ago but is it still possible to pratice sadduccee judaism? If so, where can I find out more about it?

2: What exactly do we know about them?

According to what I've read no scriptures survived the fires, but there is some information in texts written by Christians or Pharisees (although biased), where can I read it?

And 3: I'm of course interested in reading the Torah, do you have any digital recommendations with explanations so I can study it correctly?

I would prefer a physical copy but that is not possible because I'm a minor (cant order online and have a Catholic mom who wouldn't approve) and live in a small city in southern europe so there are no synagogues close by.

Im sorry if anything I said came across as disrespectful, hope you have a great day and thank you in advance."

I want to share something with you.  I am a new olim, I am learning Hebrew and enjoying it a lot, I Have a jood gob (I work in IT) and get decent salary. But I am thinking of leaving. I am really tired that a lot of my money go to taxes and I basically get very bad service, dirty streets, garbage everywhere. Sometimes I feel like I live in the third world country, I've never seen such ugly dirty  entrances (even in really poor cities in Russua aka bryansk, it's actually much cleaner there). The stores are dirty and not well organized. Service is non existent here. There aren't a lot of choices to choose from because too many monopolies and kashrut policies. And transport doesn't even work on shabbat normally lol. The prices are too high for what it offers.
I also don't feel safe at all as a woman  here :( 
I totally understand it's middle eastern country with such strong  history. I am really proud of what people built here. It's really amazing. 

Even old buildings can look nice though if you at least not throw garbage everywhere.it feels like people don't care about others and even themselves when they don't pick up their dogs shit.its annyoing. 
But sometimes I just basically can't enjoy this country :(

There are some good things I like though;
1) medical system is pretty good  and efficient
2) transport sucks, but at least not crazy 
expensive and also moveit is a cool app
3) some people are friendly and really nice
4) I am Jewish and I am enjoying a lot to learn about traditions and language!
5) israel feels very alive (I don't know how to explain this exactly) 
6) overall, you can have a good life even with those disvatanges

I know there is no ideal country and people complain everywhere. (The problems are basically the sane, cost of living inflation etc etc).Does any olim or not olim feel that way? May be you left and came back? Or you left and feel happier? 

Let's discuss :)"

It's a project that's going to take me several years (at least) as I'm only doing this part-time.   I managed to finish the first five verses of Genesis (the first day of creation) today.

This is something I've been working toward for about two years now.  After taking lessons with a Sofer (scribe), I wrote two megillos (Book of Esther) as practice for this. 

When I originally figured out that I was going to do this, I budgeted a decade for me to finish the Sefer Torah.  As it turns out, I may have to write a bit faster.  Earlier this year, I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  Fortunately, it's not the standard type of pancreatic cancer that everyone hears horror stories about, so my prognosis is somewhat better than standard, but even so... no diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (or any cancer, for that matter) is ever good.  So, I don't know if I have a decade anymore, meaning that I just have to write faster.  

To make matters worse, the chemotherapy has given me neuropathy in my fingers and toes, making it more challenging to write than when I was writing the megillos.  Nonetheless, I can still hold a pen, and I can still form letters, and the chemo portion that was causing the neuropathy has been discontinued.  So, hopefully, that will get better in the coming months (although no guarantees, of course).  

So, after two years, I've managed to reach the point where I can begin to work towards fulfilling the commandment of writing a Sefer Torah.  Hopefully, with help from Above, I will be able to continue working on it and finish it (and maybe even read from it in shul).

1,2023-09-05,Conservative Convert in Chabad Spaces,u/GoraKriofora,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16abqwb/conservative_convert_in_chabad_spaces/," Today I officially converted into Conservative Judaism! Wahoo!

But one question weighs heavily on my mind. It was a question asked by my beit din, and also a question I have been asking myself for the years I have been in this process.

How do I continue and grow my involvement as a member of my Jewish community?

In my home city, and the city I started converting in, it felt easy. We had a JCC. I worked as a teacher there. My year operated on a Jewish schedule. I was closely involved with many Jewish families. I had lots of Jewish friends, neighbors, coworkers, peers. There were constantly events, programs, and groups to be a part of. Unfortunately I struggled to find a religious community--though COVID was a major factor in that.

When I moved, I was excited to continue my conversion process in a new community (and denomination.) And happily, I found a synagogue I felt welcome in and connected to, and a Rabbi I love and respect dearly. But I found it much harder to find a broader foothold now. I regularly attend services and holiday learning programs. But at them, I either sit by myself or follow my rabbi around. The attendees of my schul are at best 35+ married couples, often older than that and with kids. Our events and programs are largely either family-oriented or geared towards older women. Which is great! But as a 25 year old gay man it makes it harder to find people to connect with. And while my city has a young adult-focused Jewish group, it meets infrequently and at times that conflict either with my work schedule or services (e.g. they have a break fast event for Yom Kippur... at the same time as Neilah.)

My new city doesn't have a JCC. But it does have a Chabad Center. And when I look at their programs--weekly Shabbat dinners, a Yiddish club, and just regular programing and outreach geared towards young adults, they seem like exactly what I'm looking for to supplement and broaden my experience (not, of course, to replace my schul.)

But for one, I know as a conservative convert, a Chabad rabbi wouldn't accept me as Jewish. And in general, my Rabbi does not have a high opinion of Chabad. In came up relatively early in my process of meeting with him, because I was constantly reading the Chabad website. He pointed out that, for one, a lot of what I was learning from Chabad resources was not accurate to conservative Judaism, which I accept and have worked to correct in my own research and understanding. But more broadly he has tsked when I've admitted going to Chabad events in the past, accusing them of being overly focused on fundraising and either feel-good one-off activities or trying to draw non-Orthodox Jews into Orthodoxy rather than supporting our city's interdenominational Jewish community. And when it has come up in the past, the other people in my synagogue have expressed very similar views or at the very least consistently disapproval. 

I'm interested in our Chabad center. But I'm very nervous about my potential experience, based on both what I know to be fact (that they wouldn't accept my conversion as valid) and based on the disapproval I have seen from my Rabbi and other members of my schul.

While I was raised in the church, my dad still taught us about Jewish culture, would take us to kosher restaurants, celebrate Hanukkah, and show us how to pray tefillin. Now that I am an adult, I have left the church and have studied lots of faiths. The only thing I know for sure is that I believe in the God of Israel, of our ancestors. I pray to Him every day and pray the Psalms. The thing is, I am not a Jew. I miss having a community of people worshiping God and, as a non-Jew, I cannot have that. What are non Jews supposed to do? Just pray in our rooms by ourselves and follow the Noahide laws (which are almost all default anyway)? I need religion, I need a spiritual teacher. Does God just want us to pray in our rooms alone and that is the extent of our interaction with Him?"

I was really hoping to get a Jewish perspective on the quality of the WatchTower Bible & Tract society’s NWT? 

Specifically the Tanach of course. 

I hear some incredibly conflicting info regarding it. Trinitarians will say it is a horrible corruption, but I’ve heard others say the NWT’s rendering of the Tanach is excellent, specifically because it leaves out trinitarian bias in the translation of words/terms commonly associated with the doctrine."

The only information about this doctor I can find seems to be advertisements for medical tourism, no papers published or anything like that, and the clinic reviews are a weird mix of 5 stars for a wide variety of conditions and 1 stars saying they’re swindlers.

I go to Jewish singles events, but it's the same people every time. I'm on the apps, but in a personal compromise, I removed the requirement that my partner be Jewish (my profile shows that I am) and still didn't get a lot of interest. I got burnt out and decided to focus on other things, but I didn't delete the apps. Imagine my surprise a few weeks ago when I visited family in a larger city and found my dormant JSwipe, Bumble and Hinge profiles getting much more interest than they did at home! I don't base my self-worth on how interested others are in me, but this piqued my curiosity (why wouldn't it?).

Now, I didn't respond to these connections for several reasons; I didn't have time, didn't want to rouse suspicion with the family I was staying with, and given A and B, I didn't want to waste the other person's time with no chance of a meetup. But I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience that, either on its own or in addition to other factors, led them to move. Any other suggestions for exploring this?"

It seems that Arab Christians preform the best in the education system out of any ethno-religious group in Israel and are overrepresented in white collar professions. I was wondering why this is? Is it perhaps that the Christian community does not have a Haredim equivalent?"

1,2023-09-05,An Atheist's Plea: Don't Skip the Piyutim!,u/xiipaoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16aezwn/an_atheists_plea_dont_skip_the_piyutim/,"The High Holidays are almost here.  We've been saying L'david for a few weeks.  We've been blowing the shofar for a few weeks.  S'fardim have been saying S'lichot for a few weeks, and Ashk'nazim will start soon.  My parents, of course, haven't been doing any such thing and have no idea what S'lichot are supposed to be.  (I once wished my mom a chag sameach on Sh'mini Atzeret, and she had no idea what it was.  I was *born* on Sh'mini Atzeret.  I'm pretty sure she was there!)  It's not just my parents, of course.  A whole lot of Jews are mostly disconnected from Jewish practice, and, well, I can't really blame them.  Not everyone is interested in Judaism; being Jewish is just a thing they happen to be, like you might be from Ohio or have blond hair or whatever, and you see no reason to spend your life going to Ohio-themed festivals or going to blond people services.  (I've never been to Ohio and I don't have blond hair, so maybe I'm way off-base here.  Not the point.)  But for those of us for whom Judaism is more than a once-or-twice-a-year thing, well, the High Holidays are almost here, and with them will come *hours* upon *hours* of *interminable* synagogue services.

Well, they're already quite long, so it's OK for them to be a little bit longer, isn't it?

Synagogues here in Non-Orthodoxistan have a few big challenges around this time of year.  The main thing are disengaged Jews who are nevertheless engaged *enough* to show up on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and this silent majority is also the silent majority of your fundraising for the year because you sell High Holiday seats for obscene amounts of money to people who won't be members because they don't come at any other time.  And the service, well, it's a *lot* of unfamiliar Hebrew, for a *long* time.  For the disengaged, this is boring, and there's some logic in making the service shorter, with some vernacular, with the highlights, etc.  If you bore the disengaged too much, they won't come next year and you'll be out a bunch of money.  But if you're going to have an all-Hebrew traditional-style service, *why oh why* does it matter to the disengaged what's actually in it?  They just want to feel the meaningfulness -- you know, the d'var where the rabbi (or whoever) talks about change or whatever -- and get the hell out.  To them, skipping around in the machzor is par for the course; what's the harm in skipping around a little bit less?  Now, sure, *some* piyutim do add a *whole* lot of extra time that doesn't need to be there, and in some situations, like Yom Kippur Shacharit between Yimloch Adonai L'olam and the K'dushah (specifically in that section), there are just too many of them and you might as well stick to the highlights.  I think that's reasonable.  But the disengaged will not care one way or the other about the r'shut after Misod Chachamim.  It won't matter.

Meanwhile, for the *engaged* Jews, the High Holiday liturgy is a deep and fulfilling experience.  I mentioned Yom Kippur Shacharit, but... what disengaged Jews even show up to Yom Kippur Shacharit, anyway?  You go on Kol Nidrei, maybe N'ilah, and that's it.  The morning service on Yom Kippur is SEVEN HOURS LONG, if not longer.  No, if you're there for seven hours, clearly it's because you're getting something out of it other than boredom.  So a good question to ask is this: what is in those seven hours, anyway?  Why is it so long, when a regular Shabbat morning service is, I dunno, like, two hours and a bit?  And almost half of that is the Torah reading.  The Torah reading on Yom Kippur is a lot shorter.  So what is it?

Here, as always, it's worth looking at what I consider the most important holiday in the Jewish calendar, Pesach.  Pesach marks the beginning of Am Yisrael as a whole, the moment when we became a people.  The Torah mentions Yom Hazikaron briefly and Yom Hakipurim a bit less briefly, but the Torah does not devote half a book to telling their stories, nor does it exhort parents to tell their children -- *four times* -- about why we continue to celebrate them.  This extreme importance is given only to Pesach, b'rosh kol moadot.  On Leil Pesach, one very important piece of liturgy separates it from all other nights, and that is the Haggadah.  We mark this momentous occasion not with a general feeling of holidayness but with a concrete expression of the holiday, a seder with a specific order and a specific set of paragraphs to read and a specific set of foods to eat.  In some traditions, even, the food is *removed from the table*!  Why?  So that the children will notice how *different* this night is from all other nights.  When we ask mah nishtanah, we're not asking about theology or about stories; we're asking about the concrete, practical aspects of the evening's progression.  We're not eating our usual food; we're not eating our food the usual way.  We raise our cups, but we don't drink.  We say bore p'ri haadamah instead of hamotzi even though the lachma anya is right there in front of us.  To the disengaged, again, these differences are not important, because there's no point of comparison.  Saying hamotzi at a different time is meaningless if you don't usually say hamotzi at all.  But even to the disengaged, the act of the seder itself is special and holy, even if the meaning of some of it is not the intended meaning, because the seder is familiar and happens only once a year (counting both nights as one event).

Now, I'm an atheist Jew.  I said that in the title.  So when I say that the seder itself is special and holy because it's familiar and happens only once a year, I mean it; I'm not being reductionist.  We say that Hashem is m'kadesh Yisrael v'haz'manim, but as I see it, *we* are m'kad'shim Yisrael v'haz'manim.  If *we* did not *make* the seder night different from all other nights, *it wouldn't be*.  What is the meaning of Shavuot or Tish'ah B'av or Yom Kippur to a non-Jew?  It's just a regular day.  But *we*, we Jews, make it special.  *We* make a little-h havdalah to discern between holy and chol, a discernment that is not made by non-Jews generally.  We imagine God as the king sitting on a throne, high and exalted, on Rosh Hashanah, and you know, I don't know whether most believing Jews believe that God is literally sitting on said chair at that particular moment, but I can tell you that before I started my engagement with Judaism, I was *not* imagining God in that position, even before I stopped believing.  When I go to shul on Rosh Hashanah morning, I want to feel the awe and majesty of this vision, because that's a big chunk of what Rosh Hashanah is all about.  I can't wait around for God to put the image in my mind.  The metaphors we use on the High Holidays help us make sense of the holiness of the day, and that's *extremely* important because, without them, that holiness simply is not there.  I've heard enough lessons explaining the concept of holiness and how it's really a separation, a dedication of something to God, whether it's a place like a synagogue, an object, a time, or even the whole Am Yisrael itself, but *we* are the ones who make that dedication.

This brings us back to the question posed above: what makes the Yom Kippur service so *long*?  Well... its holiness!  Yom Kippur is supposed to be the holiest day of the year, so you gotta pack a bunch of holiness into it.  It won't be holy by itself.  So you start with Kol Nidrei, a special service with a special name, with a shatz wearing special white clothes, slowly intoning a paragraph with a complicated melody *three times*.  At this point, it doesn't actually matter what the actual text is -- it's just some Aramaic legalese anyway -- but the solemnity of it all carries the weight of the holiday.  Maariv proceeds mostly as normal.  Then you do a bunch of special stuff with a S'lichot service tacked on after maariv, go home, come back in the morning with your HP and MP restored... but you're still hungry.  More pomp and circumstance (hopefully) when you get to Hamelech, and Shir Hamaalot responsively, but our first big, special thing happens right after Bar'chu.  See, Kol Nidrei is its own thing.  You're wearing a talit for it, which is especially weird, right?  There's no real point of comparison for Kol Nidrei.  It's not maariv plus; it's... Kol Nidrei.  Not so shacharit, which *really* is shacharit plus.  Right there at the start, instead of ""yotzer or uvore choshech"", we have ""hapoteach lanu shaarei rachamim, umeir einei ham'chakim lislichato"", and *then* ""yotzer or uvore choshech, oseh shalom uvore et hakol.""  But we're not done yet: ""Or olam b'otzar chayim, orot meofel amar vayehi.""  This line is important.  It is used to introduce piyutim called yotzrot, placed here at the beginning of the Yotzer Or blessing.  If you are familiar with the structure of the service, this extra text here is a big signal that something special is happening.  If you aren't familiar with the structure of the service, meh, it doesn't really matter so much what's going on here.

We're going to take a little break here to sing some piyutim, because this is a special Reddit post: I've been off of Reddit since the crap of June 30, and I'm just coming back to make this post, basically.  The piyut I want to sing is the very popular Chanukah piyut, Sh'nei Zeitim.  Ready?  [Here you go!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=393KDPxaSUw)  What, you're not familiar with Sh'nei Zeitim?  Pshaw, and you call yourselves Ashk'nazim.  Well, you see, Sh'nei Zeitim, beloved Chanukah piyut, is sung -- no, sorry, *was* sung -- right before Or Chadash in the Yotzer Or blessing on Shabbat Chanukah.  Traditionally, on chagim and special Shabbatot, especially in the German and Polish traditions (not sure about Litvak and Galitzyaner), there were special additions to the service inserted at various points within various blessings.  You can still find some of them in the Artscroll; for example, on Pesach, there's a little sign pointing to the page for B'rach Dodi before the end of Gaal Yisrael at shacharit, and before Pesach, there are amidah insertions on Shabbat Hagadol.  But they are not commonly done, and other mainstream siddurim don't have them (that I've seen).  At least Tal and Geshem are still around, honestly.  Who knows if they'll still exist in a hundred years.  All of these piyutim have added to the specialness of the different special days on the calendar.  The days on the calendar are still supposed to be special, right?  Shabbat Hagadol is... well, a thing, but it's not a thing with any meaning, because, as we discussed earlier, *we do not give it meaning*.  There is no special *observance* to imbue Shabbat Hagadol with extra holiness like there used to be.  Without special observances, days are not special.  The same is true for the other special shabbatot.  The chagim, well, the nusach is different, at least, and there's Hallel, but they could be a lot *more* special if we kept in the piyutim.  People would come just for the piyutim, because they're unique for the occasion.  The disengaged would maybe have to wait another 20 minutes before kiddush, but, like, we do read Shir Hashirim on Shabbat Pesach, right?  We still have double Torah portions sometimes.  It's OK!  Kiddush can wait!

On Yom Kippur morning, there isn't even that excuse.  The Artscroll says ""some congregations omit the following prayer"", but I don't think the Silverman or the Birnbaum say that (I don't have those two machzorim at home, sorry).  Don't omit the following prayer!  Don't skip the piyutim!  This prayer here, S'lach l'goi kadosh, b'yom kadosh, marom v'kadosh, is not particularly meaningful in its text, but it is very meaningful in its placement in the middle of the first b'rachah of the Sh'ma.  We don't *usually* say piyutim there, so doing it now makes Yom Kippur more special.  That said, it is kind of long and boring, but... who says it has to be sung by the entire congregation out loud?  Read the first stanza in nusach, quickly scan to the end like you're already doing for the rest of the blessing anyway, and read the last stanza in nusach.  There, that was 3 minutes total, for a massive increase in holiness.  There's another piyut in my machzor before the line ""Baruch k'vod Adonai mim'komo"", and OK, maybe skip this one, but then again, embellishing the K'dushah is another way to increase the holiness of the day, and you *could* embellish this one as well as the ones in the various amidot throughout the day.  But there's really no good reason to completely skip the first piyut here.  Don't skip the piyutim!

Then we get to the repetition of the Amidah.  Here's where things start to get really heavy, not specifically in the subject but in the quantity of the additions.  But here's the thing, and I think this is a lot more important than people give it credit for: a b'rachah in the repetition is an emotional experience.  It's an intense experience.  It's not just a pro forma reading of some words.  A good leader understands this, and when the service lands at the end of one of the seven b'rachot of the amidah, it's a thunderous and *cathartic* A-A-MEN.  But a catharsis requires an intense experience to conclude.  It feels hollow to just skip straight to the end, and yet, that's what happens.  When it's done properly, we have: a fairly slow and elaborate recitation of the main body of the Avot, then a momentous Misod Chachamim, then a r'shut, Emeicha Nasati, which is generally done in the same nusach as Misod.  There's a *second* piyut here, Imatzta Asor, and then we finally get to Zochrenu L'chayim and Melech Ozer.  It's a good couple of minutes there between start and end of Avot, so when that ""magen Avraham"" hits, it's a big moment.  Unless you skip the piyutim.  Don't skip the piyutim!  Then it's not a big moment at all; it's fast and hollow, like singing the Victory Kaddish at the end of a Friday weekday minchah before Shabbat.  There's a time for formula and a time for solemnity, and Yom Kippur is a time for solemnity.  Then we have G'vurot.  Atah Gibor, M'chalkel Chayim.  Piyut, Taavat Nefesh, usually skipped.  Piyut, Ad Yom Moto, usually skipped (despite being a pretty great text, actually).  Mi Chamocha, V'neeman Atah, done.  Skip the piyutim and that b'rachah ends weakly instead of strongly.  Don't skip the piyutim!  The time it takes to chant these piyutim -- at least one of the two in each of these two blessings should be chanted or sung fully, in my opinion -- is essential to the catharsis of the chatimah, and simply the act of saying them, even mostly silently, increases the holiness of the occasion.  Then you have another r'shut, Ichadta Yom Zeh Bashanah, Yimloch, and about a billion piyutim.  This, I think, is where it's good to be judicious.  The r'shutim are important and directly refer to the increased holiness, but all the other ones, well, not so much.  This is the point where you're really going to lose people if you don't keep it fairly snappy.  But... there aren't really *that* many, are there?  The majority should still be sung.  Don't skip the piyutim!  When we get to the K'dushah, that itself is cathartic because we finished the long section of piyutim and are now in the firmly familiar territory of the K'dushah that we all know the words to.  There are actually no piyutim here (there are at musaf; don't skip the piyutim), and we get to k'dushat hayom and S'lichot.  This section, like after maariv, is special to Yom Kippur *already*, so what additions it contains aren't particularly important towards creating the day's holiness.  There's a piyut, Yom Asher Ashamenu.  I think it's probably OK to skip this one.  But don't skip Mi El Kamocha.  Don't skip the piyutim!

Then we have no additions until the musaf Amidah, and that's about the same other than the fact that there's the Avodah -- don't skip the r'shutim, don't skip the piyutim! -- and there, well, there's a lot of stuff there that may be worth skipping, honestly.  The Avodah is *really* long.  But don't skip the piyutim!  Sh'nat Osem, don't skip it!  *Definitely* don't skip Mar'eh Chohen, for the love of all that is Jewish.  (The Machzor Lev Shalem skipped it, and therefore I no longer consider myself part of Conservative Judaism.)  Ashrei Ayin Raatah, don't skip it!  Everything after it, meh.  But don't skip the piyutim!

I think you can follow the logic for the rest of Yom Kippur.  There's a calculation that needs to happen in general: does the piyut add to the solemnity of the day?  Can it be done fairly quickly if it's not a crowd favorite?  Do you actually need to spend 10 minutes on the nai nai nais of V'yeetayu?  Will it *detract* from the solemnity if it is skipped altogether, like part of what makes Yom Kippur special is just being removed for the sake of the convenience of people who aren't there anyway?  For the piyutim, the answer is: Don't skip the piyutim!  And this goes for all of the other piyutim throughout the year, too.  The piyutim are part of what makes each special day special.  When we skip them, we make them less special.  It's not worth ending services a couple of minutes earlier for the sake of skipping them.  Don't skip the piyutim!

But... maybe you don't know any melodies for the piyutim, and neither does anyone else?  Who cares.  Use a Carlebach tune.  No, I don't want to sing Carlebach tunes either, but it's fine, everyone does it.  They're all on YouTube.  Or, I don't know, do some research, or come up with your own melody.  Find the nusach that was used in Germany and/or Poland in the 1870's (Abraham Baer's Baal T'fillah is available online).  Listen to Virtual Cantor.  Find a Sephardic High Holiday tune and adapt it.  Or just use the regular Misod Chachamim nusach for the first few and last few lines and do the rest silently.  These are surmountable problems.  Just... DON'T SKIP THE PIYUTIM!

To conclude, because this is *really* long and it's 1 AM and I have work tomorrow and holy crap this is why I stopped going on Reddit (that and the third-party app thing), don't skip the piyutim.  We create our own holiness in our holy days, and we *depend* on that holiness that we create to properly feel what we're supposed to feel, what the liturgy exhorts us to feel.  We depend on the pacing and the catharsis.  To skip the piyutim is to take all of that away.  **Don't skip the piyutim!**"

1,2023-09-05,The Hebrew language,u/c9joe,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/16ajjjr/the_hebrew_language/,"Warning: Cultural post, not so political. Maybe I will be more making posts about what I think is kind of interesting about Israel and Israeli culture. (Yes this post has little to do about Palestine.) 

Israel's official language is Hebrew. Hebrew is a very ancient language, the same language of King David. It's very related, mutually intelligible with Phoenician. It is possible for Israelis, with minimal training to understand Phoenician inscriptions from 3000+ years ago. The language used is the Phoenician alphabet, but the Phoenician alphabet is extremely similar to the ancient Hebrew alphabet. Modern Hebrew is printed in Assyrian block script or written in Ashkenazi cursive script but there is a mapping to ancient Hebrew. It is also sorta mutually intelligible with Ugarit too, enough that it is basically possible to follow their epic poems. 

But what is cool about Hebrew is it's a living language. Like for example here is a [pop song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVaeEK1WC2M) that was/is very popular in Israel. It's in the ancient language of King David, but here it's a song about small purses that is relatable to young women from thousands of years in the future. That is to me what's really cool about Hebrew it's like this super old and ancient, even a holy language, but the most mundane and modern things can be expressed with it too in a compelling way.

Hebrew as far as I know is the only time in human history where a ""dead language"" (that is one that used for everyday speech) became the language of an entire nation. This was mostly due to the work of Elizer Ben-Yehuda. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzPDmhihPBM) is a good video from Shalom Sesame about him.

Being raised a xtian I always had a lot of questions, most of which were about the incongruence of the Bible and its contents (others were about the cruel things the church has done throughout the ages)

So in the xtian religion, shabat is changed to Sunday, but funny enough, the word for Saturday in my native language is Sabota, which literally says that it's the Sabbath day. I found this very amusing and have pointed it out in a few occasions.

She has a level of religious observance that feels familiar to me as middle-aged White American Christian — it's not an all-encompassing way of life for them, but her family are believers, keepers of important Jewish traditions, and decidedly ethnic.

Since marrying, my wife and her family and friends have taught me a great deal about the Jewish people. We are raising our children Jewish, in the same congregation where she grew up. I am wholeheartedly on board with this, because I have a deep respect for the family values, dedication to children, and fiercely life-affirming attitude I have seen among most Jewish people I've met.

My wife warned me when we first started dating, that I'd be wise to view our relationship as an interracial one, because that's *exactly* how *she* would be seen and judged by her community. ""It's as different as dating a Black girl,"" I remember her warning me: Both partners may share a large amount of American culture in common, but there are very real and noticeable differences in relationship dynamics and communication style, due to very different historical experiences of America. She wasn't wrong. In engaging with my wife's family and their friend circle, I've found it's behooved me to be humble and respectful, to listen more than speak, and to check my assumptions and expectations at the door. Many Anglo-Christian Americans *think* they know Jews and Judaism, but really don't. I sure didn't. I still have a lot to learn.

The fact that my wife did not marry a Jewish man, and I did not convert, however, was and still is an occasional source of tension. I can understand the resistance to interfaith marriages. After all, when a Jew marries a non-Jew, the odds are good that they will have no grandchildren who self-identify as Jewish. Plus, the Jewish people have faced and continue to face a great deal of racism. When (not *if*) the family I married into faces mistreatment for being Jewish, they would appreciate some reassurance that I will stand by them loyally, no matter what.

I've seriously considered converting, but have decided against it, for two reasons. First, I'm still a believing Christian. I don't belong to or worship at any church, and my spirituality is more in line with Gnostic / esoteric / mystical interpretations of Christianity. But I still consider Jesus an important role model for the person I seek to become on the inside, and I don't see how that's compatible with being Jewish.

Secondly, by helping as best I can to raise Jewish children, and talking to many other people who were raised Jewish and are raising Jewish children, I've come to realize something: **Jewish is an ethnoreligious identity that is inculcated in childhood.** Having not been raised by a Jewish mother, nor studied and prayed alongside other children raised by Jewish mothers, I don't think I could ever attain a full appreciation of what it means to be Jewish. I don't know if I could ever feel fully Jewish. Jewish is an ethnicity, not just a religion. And it's highly debatable whether ethnicity is something an individual can change. I lean towards ""no"" — ancestry and early upbringing are key ingredients to any ethnic identity. I can marry into another tribe, and if I raise my children in that tribe, they will be fully acculturated members of that tribe. But even if I'm welcomed and accepted, the tribe I was raised in will always be in my bones, such that I'll never see and engage with the world the way someone does who knows no other identity. Plus, I'm not alienated from or rejecting of Anglo-Christian American culture; I just didn't choose to marry into it or raise my children in it.

As I mentioned, I'm continuing to learn more every day. I recently happened upon [the Wikipedia article on *Ger Toshav* (גר תושב)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ger_toshav), literally ""resident alien"" in Hebrew, and I wonder if this is term describes me and my relationship to the Jewish people well. I am an ally, friend, and appreciator of the Jewish people and their culture, but not a member myself, and I'm okay with that. Would most Jewish communities be okay with my adoption of this status also? My children are Jewish full stop, as children of a Jewish woman, with an exclusively Jewish religious and cultural upbringing. All three of them embrace their Jewishness wholeheartedly, and feel fully Jewish. They are not *mamzerim*, because they are not the result of sexual infidelity by a married Jewish woman. All of this remains true whether I convert or not, though I'm sure that are some rabbis who would disagree.

However, the issue of my loyalty to my family and to the Jewish community still remains. If I were to seek and attain recognition as a *ger toshav*, I suspect that might go a long way as a symbolic show of solidarity with the community. Is there a procedure or a ritual for going about doing this?

Any thoughts are welcome. Don't hold back. Be brutally critical and take me to school, if that's what you feel moved to do. I'd rather have difficult and awkward conversations like this with strangers on Reddit, than with people I'll need to see again for many years to come."

I’m incredibly interested in seeing how his tenure goes, as the current political environment in Israel along with political radicalization in the Orthodox community take American-Israel relations into uncharted territory.

Jack Lew, an Orthodox Jew who previously defended the Iran deal, is distinguishing himself from the 80% of Orthodox Jews who supported Trump in 2020. Given this ever-increasing polarization, and his upcoming work for a President whom much of the Orthodox world sees the enemy, it’s unclear whether or not he will remain in the community’s good graces for long.

It’s also interesting to see how he interacts with an Israeli government increasingly dominated by Orthodox Jews, yet who only see their way as the “right way” to be Orthodox. If Jack Lew condemns the judicial reforms and religious coercion, will he be condemned by these figures and the broader Orthodox world? We’ll have to wait and see."

When studying med I received stipendium from the two countries I had a citizenship in (I had about 1000 euro per month in total), I opened a small company, life was cheap, I had a substituted apartment and my expenses were about 200euro all included (food, rent, gym, phone...). I was in a good physical shape, abs and more. I even had a free psychologist whom I visited every week, I had cheap medication for my psoriasis, I even visited the masseur once a week. I quit everything for Hashem. 

I started to be shomer shabbat, shomer negiyah kept my eyes, my milah and so on. I went to a harsh litvish-styled yeshivah in Bnei Brak, no phone allowed. My company was not well maintained and went bankrupt. I had about 10k (euro) in my bank account when i traveled to Israel. I made big donations, I helped people near me and even stranger. I spent good money for shabbat and holidays. 

Stuff happened but now I am in a small debt, I spent today my very last 40shekels to buy pictures for my visa. I am in a new yeshivah more open (hence the post) its dati Leumi. 

Now Rosh HaShanah is here soon, but I am afraid that I will not be able to buy an Etrog and a Lulav even the cheapest one

&#x200B;

My mother is disappointed at me. I was ""there"" in the med school she was so proud, now she sees me as a homless looser and I mean she is not wrong. I had a only one jewish friend in med school he was mechalled shabbes all year and studied on shabbes while i was at shoul. Turns out he's doing fine, his mother is happy bli ain harah. 

&#x200B;

But me who choose Hashem i am lonely, poor and miserable. I hoped to maybe find a shidduch, but the last girl whom I talked to, just blocked me today without further explanation. And btw, I am not good looking anymore, I tried to make myself ugly to push women away from me (I didn't want to risk anything), so I shaved my hair (not the payes though), gained 15kg of pure fat, lost 5kg of muscle and since I cannot afford meds for psoriasis it looks like I am a reptile. 

&#x200B;

Went from being rich, successful, good-looking, athletic, loved and admired by family to poor, miserable, fat and ugly. 

&#x200B;

 Tbh my only hope is to get enlisted (as a soldier in Kfir or Golani) in August and to die Al Qiddush Hashem. 

&#x200B;

I have a serious yetzer harah to just pop like 1 or 2g of tramadol and just sleep for a while. Like if me turning to Him actually makes my life impossible to live, why should I be afraid of hypothetical consequences in a hypothetical afterlife. I mean if You exist why is my life so shitty since I follow Your rules, and it states there that he who follows them never looses... Well I lost a lot if not all i had"

Both of his parents are dead and he has no records of anything. Is there anyone we could pay to find out for him? Or anything we can do? Idk help!!! Thanks"

The concept of 7 noahide laws seems interesting but if I'm not mistaken is pretty much Judaism for gentiles. From what I've understood Jews have a 'special' pact"" with G*d and thus have to follow many and very specific rules. After some vary basic research about jewish law I came to the conclusion that this pact with G*d is actually very hard to keep and a huge responsability. Noahidism sounds much easier. Noahide have just 7 basic laws.
The question is how can someone become a noahide? Where should a noahide turn to for spiritual guidance and clearing misconceptions ? The laws are just 7 and don't obviously encompass every aspect of life. If a noahide turns to a Jewish Rabbi for guidance and help what would the rabbi do? How can the rabbi distinguish commandments that are only required for Jews and stuff that would be binding for noahides as well?"

I always thought that spending almost 3 years of your life is stupid and that ""the country should serve me, not vise versa"" and ""I'm not going to serve a country in which I can't buy an apartment"". Anyway it all started 2 years ago, I had no choice and I joined the IDF because that's the law here, otherwise the consequences will be extremely hard. I served just for a couple of months before getting my exemption for health reasons and the fact I didn't want to spend my precious time anymore. But during this time I have seen how cruel the IDF is. I always knew that the IDF treats his own soldiers in a terrible way but I've never thought about the Palestinians. A couple of months later I've started seeing videos on YouTube and Instagram and I've seen with what cruelty the soldiers treat innocent people, women and children included. I made a visit to Einabus and I saw how settlers destroy the trees of the native Palestinians, I've been in the south of the West bank near A-Samu and I've seen how a Shepard gets beaten by an IDF officer. I've been to Kfar Qadum and saw how the IDF shoots tear gas on people who protested there. I've been to Hebron and saw a city of apartheid surrounded by walls. And I finally understood the Palestinian side, I understood what people are talking about when they talk about apartheid and occupation, I understood why people tell their freedom and human rights are taken from them. But I also understood I was a part of that. Maybe I sat in the office all day and did nothing other wasting time and eating, and of course I personally did nothing wrong to Palestinians, but the fact that I became a soldier and if someone would give me a command to hurt anybody and i would do that isn't leaving me day and night. I'm feeling remorse on a daily basis that I was on the Israeli side and I just joined them instead of saying no. I wish and pray that it was possible to go back in time and go to jail instead of the IDF. Everytime I close my eyes I see the faces of the victims and it's not leaving me. I feel like a sinner, like a criminal that needs to be punished in some way. I just want to atone for ky decisions in life. I think those feelings will stay with me until my last day, and that's my punishment in this world. And for the Palestinian people all I want to say is that I'm sorry and I would never ever let one of my family join them again, not for anything in the world. Have a great night and FREE PALESTINE!🇵🇸"

I think a large not talked about part of the conflict is generational trauma.

I think israelis want security by any means necessary because what has happened to jewish people historically. Not just the holocaust but the horrible things that have happened many other places as well. This is the reason for the wall (well that and the intifada), nuclear weapons, and divisions created in the territories.

I think Palestinians want justice for what’s been done to them from the british to the heshmites issues and now the israeli occupation. I think this part of the reason gaza is more violent than the west bank since the majority of gazans are descendants of people who were kicked out or fled what is today israel to escape the war.  

I do think that as time goes and palestinians lose the justice by any means necessary and israel offers to open things up there won’t be a solution. I do think that israelis want peace more in a sense but don’t know what that’s supposed to look like."

My boyfriend is as he puts it “atheist but culturally Jewish.” Long before we met his faith was very important to him, unfortunately his abusive father tainted any ties to faith he had and no longer practices. I, myself, was raised Catholic, I no longer am actively practicing but I still celebrate and enjoy following my traditions. Recently he has been discussing the possibility of celebrating  Hanukkah this year, he even pulled out his silver menorah and has it displayed in the living room. He has been discussing other Jewish holidays as well and it has become apparent that he wants to celebrate them, just the two of us. If I am completely honest I know very little about Judaism, I know the names of “major” Jewish holidays and why they are celebrated and maybe a few things like some sects have women that have a very important milestone in their life when they can take a special bath and that not all sects have the same rules about what is classified as “work” on the sabbath, but that’s about it. My knowledge is fuzzy and at a fifth grade understanding at best. I’d like to celebrate Rosh Hashanah with him, but other than apples and honey and the braided bread I have no idea what else is typically made and eaten during the celebration. I would really appreciate if anyone could point me in the right direction of either some reading materials and/or some easy to follow recipes. I appreciate any and all help especially since it is only 10 days away!"

Yes, it’s another itinerary advice thread. My dad and I will be visiting Israel from the US for about a week, arriving a few days after Christmas and spending New Years there. I’m trying to piece together an itinerary and figure out the best way for us to get around.

Our flight arrives on a Friday at around 4:30 PM, and we leave the following Saturday morning at 1 AM, so we’ll need to arrive at the airport sometime Friday night. Obviously, we have Shabbat to contend with when going to/from the airport.

We’re Jewish, and I know my dad wants to see the usual sights of interest, so I’m thinking we’ll definitely need a few days in Jerusalem. Right now, the first thing I’m trying to figure out is if we want to stay a few days in Tel Aviv, then move over to Jerusalem, or spend the entire week in TA and just take the train out to Jerusalem each day for a few days. I’m definitely leaning towards splitting time between the two since an hour each way on the train sounds like a bit much to do multiple days.

Masada is definitely a must as well, and I’m still doing some research to see if there are any other must-see places we can reach easily from TA or Jerusalem.

I’m also not sure if it’s worth renting a car or not. I’m not opposed to the idea, especially since public transit to and from the airport won’t really be an option anyways. A car would make day trips easier, but we could also book a pre-arranged tour to places like Masada and forget about the car. Is having one for the week worth the hassle? 

Lastly, assume we end the week in Jerusalem and don’t get a car. We’ll have to check out of our hotel in the morning and I assume they’ll hold our luggage. It will be a Friday, will there be plenty of things open that afternoon and evening to keep us busy until we have to head back to the airport that night? Will it be easy to get a taxi from our hotel to the airport? 

And any other must-see places we can reach from TA or Jerusalem? 

Thank you for the advice. Going to Israel has been a life-long dream for my dad, and I booked this trip in 2019 as a Fathers Day gift for him and we were supposed to go in April 2020. Well, that didn’t happen, and we had to delay again because my mom had some health issues, so this has been a long time coming. Trying to make the most of our time there."

Decided to give Fauda on Netflix a watch before I go back to university. Been meaning to for a bit. Absolutely hooked and burnt through 3 seasons in 3 days. Been watching in Hebrew but with English subtitles.

Anyways within the show (will avoid posting plot spoilers) I noticed on multiple occasions several Arab characters whether they’re Israeli Arabs or Palestinians bring up or have interactions with Bedouins but always try to downplay or avoid interactions. Usually the connotation given in these scenes is that there’s a hatred or animosity from Israeli Arabs/Palestinians towards the Bedouin.

Obviously a tv show shouldn’t be the main basis for trying to understand communal relations and haven’t had any reading on this subject before asking this question. But as long as I’m not stepping on anything extremely sensitive how is the relations between Israeli Arabs/Palestinians and the Bedouin? Does the show get some elements correct or does it  fabricate/overplay elements for the sake of drama?

P.S. thank you in advance for any responses ☺️"

Even the State of Israel's supposed best allies seem indifferent at best to an annihilation-level policy to any Jewish life whatsoever, not just to Israeli citizens, in the State of Palestine's territory. At the very least, the State of Palestine should apply the same ancestry threshold to Jews as for Arabs, when considering citizenship for people already in the land.

When the apartheid comparisons swirl about, the usual assumption is that the State of Israel represents the National Party, and that the State of Palestine represents the African National Congress. However, disregarding all the conceptual problems with that schema, on a practical level, the ANC never had the outlawing of Whiteness and White citizenship as part of its platform. Pluralism and equality for all citizens was its moral high ground.

Today, the White population in South Africa is a little less than 8% of the overall population, not 0%. If the State of Palestine were like the ANC and had a mechanism for determining which Jews were eligible for citizenship, it could in theory have at least that percentage of Jewish citizens. Even if the State of Palestine required Jewish families to trace back ancestry going back centuries to historic Jewish localities, there would still be a substantial population, and it would be a stricter standard than what is applies to Arab families.

I find it really dispiriting that this is just me reflecting. At no point, even as a symbolic gesture of goodwill, the negotiating table never has Jewish citizenship up for consideration on one side. I think this speaks to the vastly unequal regional power dynamics, but rather than getting too macroscopic, I just want to focus on how it serves as a reminder: even the State of Israel's best allies are not that uncomfortable with Jewish people being wiped out somewhere."
1,2023-09-06,Visiting Sinai As A Lesbian,u/subwayratnyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/16be349/visiting_sinai_as_a_lesbian/,"I know this isn’t ~directly~ Israel related but i’m wanting advice and opinions from Israelis so I figured this is the best place to post! hopefully that’s okay!
My family lives in Israel and I come visit every year, sometimes twice. I’m planning my visit for next year right now and my sister (who lives here) is really wanting for us to go to Sinai as well. I know it’s a super common vacation for israelis to go on, especially young people, and i know a handful of people who have gone so i’m also really wanting to join her!
Here’s where my question comes in- We would be crossing the border from Israel (although I do have an american passport I can use), and my girlfriend will be traveling with us as well. I’m a lesbian, if that wasn’t already clear, but more importantly to this scenario, i’m butch. I have my hair cut short, I wear only men’s clothes, and have never really had an experience where i'm assumed straight, in the USA or otherwise. My girlfriend however is very classically feminine and is often persued by men- she's really only perceived as gay when we're together.
Now i'm aware of the obvious, no PDA, no mentions or references to being gay, that's a given when traveling to a country that deems your sexuality illegal. However, i'm wondering if i should at all be worried about this potential trip / if i should reconsider?
I personally know two lesbian couples who have traveled to Sinai from Israel and had a wonderful time, but they're also very straight passing, two femmes in a relationship, which is obviously very different. Unfortunately, I don't know anyone who presents even remotely like me to ask, so here I am!
So- if you're a non-straight passing queer who has been to sinai (especially a woman) or have a friend who is, what do you think??

TLDR: Sister wants to travel to Sinai from Israel, I am a butch lesbian and trying to gauge if it's truly safe for me since i can't pass as straight, even if i tried"

Does one typically wear it all day, all night (except when showering)?

Does one usually wear the same tallit katan during the day as during the night, or should one have a separate tallit katan for the night?

Can I clean it by putting it in a washing machine like any other article of clothing?

I have both Sephardic and Ashkenazi tzitzit (my mother is Sephardic and my father Ashkenazi). Do I go by my father when choosing between the two? Can I wear both at once, or is it unusual to wear two at the same time?

Do I still wear tallit katan while I’m praying with tallit gadol?

I (26 M) was born from Jewish mother and non-jewish father. I was however not raised Jewish. In fact, my mother too was not raised Jewish. Her mother, Jewish born, raised and dead, was an American-Hungarian Jew whose parents fled from WW2 torn Europe back in 1933, and apparently refused to raise her daughters as Jewish women, perhaps in spite of what happened in her parents' home country. 
That said. I have, on paper, no connection to the Jewish culture, traditions and knowledge. I have never opened a Torah. I do not know how to pray. I have not done a bar mitzvah. I am not circumcised. 
I have never attended a synagogue. I do not know how to celebrate shabbat. Only time I did so was on a Taglit trip I took to understand something about my roots. 
I do not know Jewish festivities, when they are and what ceremonies take place. I don't have Jewish friends and my city has a Jewish community of maybe 10 individuals. The synagogue has been turned into a Jewish memorial/museum.

That all said I do identify as Jewish, for what little I've learned as long as my mother is Jewish then I am as well.
But I want to learn. I've tried to ask for help with a Rabbi, we sometimes talk on the phone. 
The learning curve is massive. It's daunting. I can't find the time or mental focus to sit and learn on my own. What I need (or should have needed years ago) is a community, but then again that's nonexistent where I live.

What do y'all say? What should I consider myself?"

Due to this I have not been to High Holy Days services for almost a decade. This year I will be attending services at the local Chabad (I am in Northern Virginia). I will also be participating in the Yom Kippur fast for the first time. I have never been to any Chabad event or service before. I would say I consider myself Conservative at this point and will probably start looking to join a congregation next year.

Few questions:

1. How should I dress for a Chabad service?

2. Is there any chance of yechi stuff appearing at the services?

3. Since it has been almost a decade since the last time I took part in Yom Kippur, should I do anything extra above and beyond the standard to atone for my transgressions since then?"

1,2023-09-06,Is my daughter Jewish?,u/bjeebus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16bpcnx/is_my_daughter_jewish/,"So my wife's family is complicated.  My MiL is 100% Ashkenazi, per ancestry.  She was raised Jewish, by Jewish parents who had Jewish roots as far back as they knew.  We were still surprised to find out there was 0% admixture at all.  Anyway, my wife was conceived out of wedlock in the time of Murphy Brown.  At that time her mother had basically stopped any religious practice.  However my FiL is hardcore fundamentalist Baptist (how they ended up together may be a mystery for the end of time).  Sometime before they married, but after my wife's conception, my MiL converted to the FiL's nutso fundamentalism because that was the only way he would marry her.  She claims to be a true believer, and that may be true now, but I think originally it was all because she was scared to be an unwed mother.  

My wife was raised in that hyper-conservative Christian church, and didn't really start questioning them until the latter half of college.  She remembers praying with her family that her Jewish grandparents would find Christ.  At the same time her mother would still break out the menorah for Hanukkah because she liked the candle lighting, and liked to cook a Rosh Hashanah meal just because she liked that food.  When we started dating in her senior year of college my wife started to move away from her fundamentalist upbringing and now we are both atheists.  When she got a job teaching at a JCC Pre-K, completely by coincidence, she got to know the religious coordinator, a conservative rabbi's wife, well.  The rabbi's wife was insistent that my wife was still Jewish despite it all.  Certainly there was an argument for my wife having Jewish/Hebrew heritage.  

So now we come to the issue of our daughter.  _If_ my wife is Jewish, would that carry to our five week old daughter?  Or would my wife have to have been at some point a practicing Jew?  There is the obvious factor that she is genetically Jewish.  My wife returned several recessive Ashkenazi genetic disorders which if my daughter ever decides to conceive a child of her own she'll need to have her partner screened for.  Jewish culture has worked it's way back into my wife's life through the connections she made at her job at the JCC.  We've spent many Passovers at the table of the aforementioned Rabbi.  She started lighting a menorah like she did as a kid, which I've decided is not too different in this situation than the Christmas tree we put up even though neither of us are Christian.  

Where does the boundary between religiously and ethnically Jewish lie?  For reference, I'm an atheist who according to my mother would be an Irish Catholic apostate.  There's plenty of opportunity to involve my daughter in Irish American activities that aren't exclusively Catholic in nature.  Are there secular Jewish activities?  Does my daughter even merit involvement as a member of a Jewish community in a completely secular manner?  The issue ultimately being she is the daughter of an atheist who is the daughter of a woman who was raised Jewish but converted to Christianity, and who we have no intention of raising religiously in any faith.  But we do want her to have an understanding of her familial heritage"

The account in Exodus doesn't appear to make a distinction whether God was including this practice as part of the yearly observation, or just for the first instance where it would have an immediate, practical effect.

Do Orthodox Jews put blood on their doorposts today? Did they do this each year in ancient times? Please include any references available."

I went to a very white synagogue where I was constantly probed about how Jewish I was and honestly I didn’t mind it because at the end of the day they gave me community and that’s all you need. Now as an adult when ppl see my Star of David and then see my partner who “looks” Jewish they assume I either converted or is just practicing for his sake. I know it shouldn’t bother me and for the most part it doesn’t but I went to a wedding where the bridesmaid kept probing me about my necklace and if I even know how important it is and when I told her I’m Jewish she scoffed and said “but are you really? Tell me your heritage, i didn’t even know there were Jews that side of the world “ I honestly just froze and changed the subject. Is this how my kids lives are gonna be? No matter where they go if they aren’t white presenting they are going to keep answering these stupid questions for the rest of their lives ?

1,2023-09-06,Interfaith Marriage (Jewish woman & Catholic man),u/DreamcatcherGoneWild,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/16bv2bc/interfaith_marriage_jewish_woman_catholic_man/,"Hello everyone! 

I recently got engaged to my man after almost 6 years of being together a few days ago. I am so happy as well as my loved ones - we are planning to wed next summer!

Here’s the thing - I am an observant Conservative Jew and he is Catholic (he’s of Irish, Polish & Italian background). Although he is not religious (he doesn’t go to church every Sunday, eats meat on Fridays, he only celebrates Christmas and Easter - which he goes to church with his family) I am still concerned how this can work since everyone is Jewish in my family (actually and ironically, my dad was born Catholic but converted to Judaism before marrying my mom and both my parents are observant, practicing Jews).

As I mentioned, I come from a tight-knit Conservative Jewish family. My mom and her family are Israeli and being both Jewish and Israeli (I have an Israeli passport, lived in Tel Aviv for a while and can speak/understand basic Hebrew) is really important to me and to my family especially as I got older I’ve come to appreciate and respect my Jewishness. Growing up we frequently attended shul, we observed Shabbat for the most part and of course the holidays (especially High Holidays) were always a big deal at home.

So being engaged and getting married to someone who isn’t Jewish is sorta a big commitment. I spoke both my fiancé and family about this. My parents like my fiancé - he finished law school and passed the bar (which is a huge plus for my mom) and he is respectful and sweet to my parents. My dad (who is a convert) likes my fiancé and mom (although she likes him personally) is a lot more concerned about preserving our family’s faith. I spoke to my fiancé about our interfaith union and I told him upfront that I want to continue being an observant/practicing Jew and we both want children one day and I want the kids to be raised in the Jewish faith. And my man said that he’s all for it. Also, one thing that really won over my parents was that my fiancé said that he wants to study Judaism (not to convert) but to fully understand what Judaism means and how important it is.

Sorry for rambling and let me get to the point, I’m curious for those in a interfaith marriage (especially between a Jew and a Catholic) how is your life like? In regard to religious practices, to raising kids and if you live solely in a Jewish home or if you split it 50/50 half Jewish, half Catholic at home.

I’m curious about experience. 

Thank for reading this and I hope all of you are safe and doing well :)"

I love my mother and am much closer with her than my father, but my ethnic pride and identity as well as religious belief are that of a Jew (my father). Even as a young child I always believed in the 1 g-d despite my mother trying to raise me as a Christian, and in terms of self-identity I wasn’t raised around my mother’s family due to cost of travel. I was exclusively socialized around my father’s family. I don’t struggle with self identity, I’ve chosen to undergo (and am nearly done with) the process of conversion, and I take deep pride in my Jewish heritage. However I find non-Jews/gentiles are always the ones to remind me of my mother’s lineage, both for positive and negative reasons.

I don’t insult my mother and talk about this stuff, but I don’t see myself as a Brazilian, I don’t speak the language, I reject and abhor the religion, and my heart sings for Hashem and K’lal Yisrael. This post is mostly just a rant, but I wanted to vent because it’s frustrating when people remind me of my non Jewish heritage. I’m not ashamed of my mother, or of who I am, I’m very firmly entrenched in my identity, but it’s annoying and frustrating dealing with other people who try to put labels I don’t ascribe to, unto myself."

I am not an employee of the synagogue and yet I face a lot of pressure to show up all the time, to host frequent large events in our home, and even to help create programming. Congregants are very forthcoming about their opinions and expectations of how I should be as a rebbetzen (seemingly inspired by generations of women place who acted as unpaid employees for decades at a time), from what I wear to how I act...I'm under pretty constant scrutiny and people take everything I say or do so personally....

&#x200B;

I wish my role was more defined, as I feel very intruded upon, pressured, and disrespected by the way they put expectations on me without paying me....the holidays are coming up and I'm just feeling really sad...on the one hand, I feel that the way I'm treated is unacceptable and I want to go anywhere else for the holidays. On the other hand, I love my husband and want to be with him...not to mention our families are both going to be in town.   


I feel like what I need is a more defined role. The informality of the role creates a situation where literally hundreds of individual congregants make up on their own what my role is supposed to be and project it onto me, but I have no actual power and the staff of the shul is just generally shitty and so hard to work with...

At the same time...the sad thing is I genuinely love being a rebbetzen...I love Judaism and hosting people in my home. I love teaching kallah classes and taking women to the mikveh. I love being the store of Jewish knowledge in the home...these are the things I enjoy and would like to do. I also love being with my husband at shul and helping to welcome people... I guess I'm just feeling badly treated by the specific institution...not to mention all this work is expected of me, and it's probably 10-20 hours of work in any given week, but it's all unpaid. They have a staff that gets paid and they really suck and often undermine the work I do....like coming to a program I put on and sitting in the back and talking while I'm song-leading...or forgetting to put tablecloths on the tables they set up for one of my events....it just feels insulting to me...I feel like a doormat, literally being abused by the entire community...(I know I just talked about the staff, but it's the old ladies who gossip at kiddush, and the ppl who watch and comment on everything I do, and the sisterhood having the gall to call me and ask me to pay for membership...) 

My husband recognizes how badly I'm being treated and recently went to the board and asked them to pay me for my work. He offered for them to take the money out of his own salary so that it wouldn't cost them anything, just that I should be paid and recognized for my work. They said no. Apparently, paying the Rebbetzen for her labor is somehow against the values of this synagogue....

I know a bunch of you are going to say: ""it's not your job, just don't go and say no to that stuff"" but it's not so easy...not to mention because I'm actually a religious Jew myself, and my own connection to Judaism is one that makes me want to be a team with my husband, and share a mission in our lives where we can work together as two sides of a project... 

I understand there are long legacies and traditions here, but surely they can be updated and changed....this was my first year as a Rebbetzen (we just got married) and I don't want to be like the senior Rabbi's wife, or the wife of the Rabbi emeritus who is still around....both those women worked their whole lives for this synagogue for free and without recognition....I'm an educated person with a real career and skills of my own...I do want to show up and do the work, but I want to do it well and be recognized for it just like any other Jewish professional would be....is that really so crazy? 

Anyway....you tell me Jews of reddit: What's the role of the Rebbetzen? I'm really curious to hear what this community might come back with...thanks in advance, and please be kind..."

I was raised Jewish. I am Jewish. Synagogue, Sunday school, bar mitzvah, I even had a Jewish wedding recently. I’ve always been proud of that unique identity and the struggles my ancestors went through for me to exist (some escaped Kiev in late 1800s, other side was decimated in Holocaust). 

But I’m in a weird place. I hope it is just a knowledge issue. When I go to synagogue, I don’t feel like I fit in. I am American politically conservative (in general) and very involved in weight lifting, martial arts, and am a sportsman. I wish there was a way to type this to not sound egotistic but I really feel like an odd one out. Obviously the communities are so nice, as any Jewish community I’ve been a part of, but I definitely don’t relate very well. I can get past that, if it wasn’t the second thing.

I feel like the synagogues I’ve been to (4 in my life, all reform) typically talk about the same thing every day. How we are always victims and to love and be accepting (which of course is good). But there’s other topics I want to hear about too. I see Christian pastors talk about discipline, family values, not expecting G-d to do things for you, all that and wonder why we don’t get the same messages (at least where I’ve gone)?

so, basically I dont have problem with Judaism,   


but, I was surprised these good people were Zionists, makes me wonder why they think they are right!   
you are Invading other people countries.   


I want to hear the answer from Zionists here!   


Palestanians have been on this earth of thousands of years, and when you left Egypt you stayed in the land for 400 years, then you were forced to leave it.   


at least, shouldnt be the right way to do it! you keep palestanians where they are and you start building houses near them but, not stealing their houses! they have lived here for so many years, its just not Logical to get there and start taking their houses and claim everything here is yours!   


for example, now I dont blame young Isarelis who are born in Israel and their dad is born there, it just feels like its their home. where else would they go! but, also what about who lived there for thousands of years! shouldnt we think about them(Palestinians)?   


not talking about Israel took a part of our  Syiran land! which isnt theirs at all!!!  
we have been in Syria before even Israelis came to Jerusalem from Egypt.

> Did the ADL make a huge mistake in joining the call for advertising boycott before Musk even had a chance to get his land legs? Unquestionably. Was ADL *responsible* for the boycott or for what became of twitter under Musk? No. So we agree the one Jewish org is being scapegoated.

> Does ADL have a pro-censorship problem? Again, yes. Is calling to ban the group a legit response in defense of free speech? Lmao, the question answers itself.

> Has ADL strayed from its mission in a way that has enabled certain deadly strains of antisemitism to fester? Yes. Do the alt-rightniks driving a campaign to ban the one Jewish org on account of its supposed ""anti-white"" bias care about stopping antisemitism? Again, lmao.

> The 'ban the ADL' hashtag contains no wisdom, no good faith, no allies. It's akin to people trying to pass off antisemitism as 'anti-Zionism.' You can join a social-media mob led by trustfund skinheads if you want, but stop calling it constructive criticism.

What motivates you to do this, when those around you aren't? 

For me I keep a modified kind of kosher that feels achievable with my lifestyle. I never willingly eat pork or shellfish or mix dairy and beef in the same item (but with some pretty glaring loopholes, like I basically don't ask don't tell about if their dairy in my hamburger bun, or I might accept a bite of a friend's pizza slice even if I wouldn't mix those two on my own plate etc). I don't bother seperating chicken from dairy and I don't worry at all about dishes.... But I honestly can't remember explain why beyond two factors. 1) I was a vegetarian for almost 20 years so it's easy to keep skipping something I long lost the taste for; I also find that post vegetarian it feels natural and even comfortable to have off limit foods for some spiritual purpose. And 2) it's easy enough to do and it connects me to our community in certain ways - so, why not? 

But I almost feel like these are particularly ""strong"" reasons and am searching for some kind of grander purpose conviction or belief within myself.

Long story short, I was contemplating this all during my Elul journaling today, and it made me curious how this shakes out for others. 

So - if you keep any kind of kosher - why? And in a world where very few of us follow every law and mitzvot, why do you care about these ones?"

And what if a kosher pet died on Sabbath? Like you have a pet chicken and it dies right on the living room. Would you need to wait until Sunday so you could take the body away or is it not considered work?

I never go out and at home when I am not working.  Most of my friends are in relationships and they aren't available most of the time. I work with people much older than me and its not very social. Switching jobs is not an option right now. 

This may be a dumb question, but how and where can I meet new people? My goal is to make some new friends. I tried going out alone but I just end up being on my phone and I feel awkward. My uncle who lives here tells me to sign up for a course but I don't know what would be social enough to meet people.

I come to you with a heartfelt request on behalf of a group of single Hasidic Cohen men who are actively seeking marriage. 

We are looking for single Charedi women between the ages of 20 to 35 who are open to the possibility of a match, potentially involving relocation to Israel.

About the Match:

- We are specifically seeking Ashkenazi Charedi women who are deeply committed to their faith and religious practices. 
- The eligible men are from the Hasidic Cohen families and are looking for partners who share their values, beliefs, and commitment to a Hasidic way of life.
- Some of the men are considering the possibility of moving outside of Israel in the future, so a willingness to discuss this potential change is important.

If you or someone you know fits this description and is interested in exploring a potential match with one of these Hasidic Cohen men, please reach out or share this post. Finding the right match can bring immense joy and fulfillment to both individuals involved.

Please be respectful and considerate in your interactions.

Thank you for your support in this endeavor, and may we all find happiness and meaningful connections on this journey.

Shalom!"

I go to school in an area with quite literally no Jews so it's most likely something done by a non-Jew. 

It feels very insensitive - the artwork looks like a self portrait, and it most likely is either that or the portrait of a friend (the art course gives you more points if you get a real life reference).  

I don't know if I should even ask if the person who made it was Jewish. I've never made a complaint about something like this and I doubt it would go down well."

They mostly hated going but sometimes said it was a little fun. It was a Sunday morning Chabad thing and extremely casual. It was a mix of ages and they often felt like it was too babyish for them. It was the best option for us because all of the other “schools“ are too far away or way more involved than we want. This school was as fun as it would get!

This is historically inaccurate at best and disrespectful to the victims of the Shoah at worst.

I struggle to understand how anyone be unaware that the Final Solution, as architected at the Wannsee Conference by Reinhard Heydrich et al., focused exclusively on the Jewish People. [The minutes have been available for decades](http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/holoprelude/Wannsee/wanseeminutes.html). From the very beginning, it focused exclusively on us. The minutes began with:-

""At the beginning of the discussion Chief of the Security Police and of the SD, SS-Obergruppenführer Heydrich, reported that the Reich Marshal had appointed him delegate for the preparations for the **final solution of the Jewish question** in Europe and pointed out that this discussion had been called for the purpose of clarifying fundamental questions. \[...\]""

Converting to Judaism?,u/Stealthfox94,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/16cv6tb/hanukkah_bush_converting_to_judaism/,So I am in the process of converting to Judaism and extremely happy about it. I will say there is one minor concern I have. Growing up I always loved the smell and appearance of a Christmas tree. I know Hanukkah bushes (trees) are a thing. When I looked up this sub and other Reddit Jewish based subs. It seems the opinions on it are extremely and I do mean extremely negative. Borderline condescending. I wonder why this is. Christmas trees have a pagan origin based on Yule. My fiancé and our goal is to one day decorate our house for numerous Jewish holidays. I think I would like the idea of a well decorated and respectful blue and white Hanukkah tree. I just find the condescending attitude towards them slightly hurtful.

My cat went on the counter and somehow managed to puke on my tea carafe 😭 so its no longer parve or kosher (I have a mostly dairy kitchen) and I can’t kasher it bc the tops made of plastic and also I don’t want it after it had cat puke on it. So I used the other one but it has a digital thermometer on the top, and I thought I could avoid activating it, but it turns out I cannot, so then I took the top off and sadly my tea didn’t stay warm. I also accidentally left rice on the warmer overnight and it smelled pretty bad the next day. When I woke up I felt sick and wanted hot tea but it was cold and I had smelly rice (oh, and this was on my birthday) so I retreated to my bedroom to read Torah with my cold tea. Not the most exciting disaster but felt like a mess at the time.

Now I’d like to hear about your Shabbat disasters. Please and thank you. :)"

I just find it hard to be shomer shabbat, what do you say to your secular friends when you fall of the face of the earth for a day? This might be easy if you have strictly jewish friends i assume. But how do you integrate being shomer shabbat? Little by little? All at once? I need advice!

I would like to visit Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, and perhaps other areas of the region.

I understand that some Muslim majority countries are intolerant of other religions, while some Muslim majority countries are tolerant of other religions, and I am not certain how a Jewish majority country would be for a practicing Catholic. What do you think the quality of life would be for a person to live and practice the Catholic faith in your country?

The woman who ran the friendship circle gave me a gift but I want to return it(this was back in dec 2019/Jan 2020). I did speak with him on the phone in 2019,and he didn’t sound too friendly,he asked me if I work and I said no I am disabled.I should have kept my mouth shut.the rabbi lives in upstate ny.

First, I want to say that I was raised Christian and then I left the religion. As I am right now, I don't really belong to any particular religion or practice.

That being said, I would like to create a story about angelology and The Bible in the Jewish perspective.

I've recently gotten into esotericism (or just learning about the history and philosophies about different religions) and as somebody who was raised Christian, I found learning about the origins of the religion super interesting and genuinely enlightening.

But I also love learning about angelology and demonology and now I'm trying to write an original story about it.

I've been studying little by little, about ""finite"", ""infinite"", how there's no ""fallen angels"" or ""original sin"" (if I understand it correctly). Basically, everything I thought about angels and demons before has been turned on its head. But I would like more resources if possible.

My story does lean heavily on the idea of consequences and choice, with the conflict being that people love to, I suppose, be ""more"" than they really are or... basically the Christian idea of asking for forgiveness = being able to go to heaven, no forgiveness = hell and other stuff around that nature. And how it actually just creates a vicious cycle or maybe gives people a sense of false hope. Leading them onto an idea that isn't guaranteed. Or something like that.

I'm trying to make sense of it because I'm new to all of this and philosophy as a whole but if there are any resources that can help me, I'd love to know. Even just for my own curiosity about the subject because I do love learning about it.

I probably threw a bunch of words at you and I apologize. There's a lot of information and I'm trying to figure out which info comes from which source so I apologize for my ignorance."

I follow a Jew Rabbi on Youtube and he says some interesting stuff but it seems not all Jews really think the same the same way like Christians generally agree  with each other.

So here are some of the things he has said and I would like to know if this is accurate for all Jews or not.

1. We've all been here before. (Some type of reincarnation belief)

2. There is no hell where you go to be punished forever. It's rather an adjustment or something along those lines. In other words Hell is just temporary.

3. A piece of your soul stays behind when you leave your body. For example if someone visits your grave you will know in heaven.

4. You feel shame when you disconnect from you body and it's also a painful process that feels like hell for the firt few days until you adjust to being without a body. (Usually after 11 months) depending how long you lived and how attached you were.

5. Lots of problems you gotta deal with in heaven when you first get there. It's also like a retirement home. This is in contrast to christian belief that there's no problems or pain in Heaven at all.

6. He said something along the lines of us coming back someday and reanimating our bodies? I'm not sure if I misunderstood. Please clarify."

This actually makes a lot of sense to me. If I dated someone with the exact same music tastes for example, then it would be boring. It would be much more fun if she would introduce me to her music tastes.

On the other hand, if I had the exact same music tastes as her, then that's how I end up getting friendzoned right? Too many similarities = boring? Should I be ruling out people who have the same tastes and opinions as dating material?"

But have you ever wondered if there might be any connections or parallels between this story and the Eastern concepts of karma? Let's embark on a journey of exploration and discussion.

&#x200B;

In the Adam and Eve narrative, we have the concept of original sin, where the first human beings disobeyed a divine command, leading to consequences that reverberated throughout human history. Could this story share any common ground with Eastern traditions, where actions are believed to generate karma, affecting not just the individual but also the collective consciousness?

I'm eager to hear your perspectives and insights on this matter. Do you see any parallels, symbolic connections, or philosophical overlaps between these two seemingly distinct narratives? Are there lessons or wisdom we can draw from examining their potential interplay?"

Does G-d really recreate everything instantaneously every single second? (Not literally every second, more like an infinitesimally small period of time).

If this were true, then that means every single moment in your life is a fresh start - it would mean that all of your mistakes should be forgotten.

Bios written/submitted by the subjects.

* [/u/mstreiffer](https://www.reddit.com/u/mstreiffer) **\[Reform\]** \- I'm a Reform rabbi, ordained at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. I've served as a congregational rabbi for 16 years (most of it in Toronto but some in North Carolina). I run a virtual Beit Midrash (centre for Jewish learning) called LAASOK.org that brings together people who want to study Jewish texts in an inclusive, egalitarian environment.
* [u/sonoforwel](https://www.reddit.com/user/sonoforwel) **\[Conservative\]** \- I am a Conservative rabbi, ordained in 2014 at the Jewish Theological Seminary, where I also attained an MA in Talmud and Rabbinics. I serve as Rabbi Educator of a small congregation in North-East Los Angeles, California, where I live with my wife and two kids. I grew up in Colombia, South America, and continue to work with mixed-language communities in Southern California.
* u/RabbiNover **\[Conservative\]** \- I am a Conservative Rabbi (Ordained At JTS in 2019). I also have an MA in Hebrew Bible, an MA in Jewish Education, A BA in Physics and a Graduate certificate in Israel Education. I am a pulpit rabbi, the main service leader and Torah reader at my congregation, director of a synagogue supplementary school program, and coordinator of the local, multi-denominational Intro to Judaism class. I love to teach about Judaism, and often introduce unconventional approaches, including everything from Jews and Zombies to Jews in Space to simply the Kashrut of eating locusts. I'm originally from Texas, went through a Conservative Hebrew School, and after a year of science research, teaching Science, and Jewish Study (all different pre-college programs) I knew I wanted to end up in Jewish Education.
* [u/dlevine21](https://www.reddit.com/user/dlevine21) **\[Pluralistic/Post-Denominational\]** \-  Shana Tova, My name is Daniel Levine and I'm currently a Rabbi in Irvine, California, working as the Campus Rabbi for Hillel and teaching in the Jewish Studies department at UC Irvine! My background is modern Orthodox - but I currently identify as post-denominational/pluralistic. I’m a frequent writer and podcaster and you can find my materials posted on Facebook and Instagram (just look up my name!). When not talking Judaism I’m an avid rock climber and mountaineer. AMA!
   * [Here is a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/igzotq/im_an_orthodox_raised_currently_pluralistic_rabbi/) to Rabbi Levine’s AMA
* [u/rabbifuente](https://www.reddit.com/user/rabbifuente) **\[Non-denominational/Traditional\]** \-  I grew up at a Reform synagogue in the Chicago suburbs. After years of independent study and learning with some wonderful Chabad rabbis I received smicha from a small, independent program out of New York in 2021. I would say I am a ""non-denominational"" rabbi, however I fall somewhere around Traditional/MO in terms of theology. I like to think that having grown up Reform and now being on the more traditional end of the spectrum gives me a certain perspective that many find helpful. Currently, I am focusing on small group/1:1 study and ""religious"" counseling. I am always more than happy to talk to anyone about Judaism, answer questions, etc. Outside of rabbinics, I am an avid bread baker and microbakery owner, cigar enthusiast, passionate home cook, and pickle snob.
* [u/SF2K01](https://www.reddit.com/user/SF2K01) **\[Orthodox\]** \-  Originally from Columbus, Ohio, I was exposed to a variety of denominations growing up, from Reform to Orthodox, before settling on Modern Orthodoxy as a teenager. I only attended public schools and went straight to college after high school, attended the University of Cincinnati and got my undergraduate degree in Jewish Studies. Afterwards, I spent 2 years in Israel learning in Shapell’s Darche Noam before coming to Yeshiva University for my graduate degree in Jewish History at Revel and achieved Rabbinic Ordination through YU’s Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, particularly with Rabbi Ezra Schwartz, Rabbi Dr. Jeremy Wieder, Dr. Steven Fine, Dr. Lawrence Schiffman, and Dr. Yaakov Elman. After completing my studies, I worked in outreach for a few years before pivoting to become a fundraiser for Jewish educational institutions. Aside from my Rabbinic and Academic interests, I am a longtime gamer, sci-fi and tech enthusiast, and reside in Washington Heights, Manhattan, with my wife, daughter, and two Siamese cats.
* [u/rebthor](https://www.reddit.com/user/rebthor) **\[Orthodox\]** \- I'm an Orthodox rabbi living in Queens, NY. I received my semicha from a yeshiva in Queens that's small enough that I would dox myself if I said the name. I also learned at Sh'or Yoshuv in 5TFR for little while. I grew up non-Orthodox in Buffalo, NY primarily in the Conservative movement and was very active in USY. I also was very close to the Chabad rabbis there and have a special place in my heart for Chabad although I don't identify as Lubavitch. I love learning halacha so my favorite rabbis are generally poskim; I often refer to the Aruch HaShulchan, R' Moshe Feinstein, Maran Ovadiah Yosef and the Tzitz Eliezer when trying to figure out what to do. I also am a big fan of the works of R' Jonathan Sacks and libadel R' Dovid Hofstedter. I have 4 children, a dog and a wife who has put up with me for near a quarter century. To pay the bills I work as a programmer. In my free time, I like to read, play video games, be disappointed by the Mets, Bills, Sabres and Tottenham and bake sourdough bread.
* [u/fullhauss](https://www.reddit.com/user/fullhauss) **\[Orthodox\]** \-  I grew up in the LA area, and was very involved in the Conservative movement. In college I shifted to Orthodoxy while obtaining a BA in Judaic Studies. After college, I spent two years studying at Shapell’s/Darche Noam before going to Yeshiva University to obtain my Smekha. I have worked at a Jewish day school and now work with college students on campus.
* [u/NewYorkImposter](https://www.reddit.com/user/NewYorkImposter) **\[Orthodox (Chabad)\]** \- I'm Chabad-affiliated, but don't like labels due to the stigmas and assumptions that often come along with them. I have Chabad Smicha from Israel/Singapore which I got after completing post-highschool Yeshiva Gedolah in Melbourne and Crown Heights. I've previously hosted services in New Zealand and Sydney. I currently use my Smicha informally in informal outreach in the Australian film industry and the Sydney Jewish community (and occasionally on Reddit and Discord 😉).

1,2023-09-08,What does G-d say about the parent-child dynamic?,u/FairReflection7685,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16dc3fj/what_does_gd_say_about_the_parentchild_dynamic/,"Am I required by G-d to try getting along with my parents no matter what? If I don't, will my life spiral out of control because I'm going against His design?

From my understanding, Judaism tells us that everything in the world has a sort of ""role"" to play - a role assigned by G-d. The chicken's role is to be food for man. Man is inherently superior in that relationship.

Can the same be said about the parent-child relationship? It feels like in the parent-child relationship, G-d has given parents more flexibility to do whatever they want. The parent doesn't have to apologize simply because they're the parent - they're the boss.. Even if the parents' decisions are questionable. And it seems G-d requires the child to be obedient and kind to his/her parents no matter what the parents do.

Basically what I want to know is.. was this power imbalance part of G-d's deliberate design? Just like he designed the chicken to be eaten by man, and the chicken cannot complain.. Are children naturally supposed to be the chickens who never complain?

The result of that was that hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been living for more than a decade under constant unguided rocket fire, astronomical amount of money that was spent on the Iron Dome and its rockets to protect those cities, in additional to another constant PR damage from the siege that Israel was forced to impose on the strip, and Palestinian casualties in it - many say that Hamas is the best PR gift Israel has ever gotten, so take the PR damage with a grain of salt.

1,2023-09-08,"“Even Hitler” says Mahmoud Abbas, PA president",u/AnakinSkycocker5726,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/16dffhd/even_hitler_says_mahmoud_abbas_pa_president/,"It’s never a good sign when a dictator delivers a rambling historical lecture, in the style of Fidel Castro or Vladimir Putin. Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, proved the point on Aug. 24 before the Fatah Revolutionary Council. His subject? The Jews.

Most media will ignore his comments, which were translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute. They don’t fit the liberal narrative that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a clash of two nationalisms that can be resolved in a “peace process” if Israelis make more concessions. The comments also don’t fit the narrative, gaining ground among Democrats, that the Israelis are extreme and the Palestinians progressive.

“The truth that we should clarify to the world,” Mr. Abbas began, “is that European Jews are not Semites. They have nothing to do with Semitism.” He cited the Khazar hypothesis, which speculates that Ashkenazi Jews aren’t descended from the Holy Land, hailing instead from the medieval Tatar kingdom. 

This has been discredited by a century of scholarship; today, it’s a theory one expects to find only in online fever swamps. But its usefulness in denying the Jewish connection to the land of Israel has made it a mainstream claim among Palestinians.
Mr. Abbas kept going. “They say that Hitler killed the Jews for being Jews, and that Europe hated the Jews because they were Jews. Not true,” he averred. Europeans “fought against these people because of their role in society, which had to do with usury, money and so on.” 

“Even Hitler,” he added, “said he fought the Jews because they were dealing with usury and money.” Yes, even for Hitler, “this was not about Semitism and anti-Semitism.”

Three days before Mr. Abbas’s speech, his Fatah party’s military wing competed with Hamas to take credit for the murder near Hebron of a Jewish preschool teacher, Batsheva Nigri, in front of her child. If you wonder why the Oslo peace process hit a dead end and stayed there, consider that Mr. Abbas and Fatah have been described for decades as “moderates.”

At age 87, Mr. Abbas isn’t likely to abandon his conviction that Jews are interlopers in every part of Israel. His predecessor, Yasser Arafat, once stunned President Clinton’s negotiators by denying even that Jerusalem had been the site of the Jewish Temple. Maybe it’s time American liberals stopped being surprised. There’s a reason Arab-Israeli negotiations have moved past the Palestinian veto.

1,2023-09-08,I feel like I’m being gaslighted,u/peepeehead1542,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/16dfmy4/i_feel_like_im_being_gaslighted/,"Important context- I am a Jewish young adult. During my teen years I went straight for anti-Zionism and I’m currently working my way backwards. I don’t generally consider myself a Zionist, because I feel like no one really knows what it means. But as a Jew and a student of History I know that we come from the Levant and ultimately I believe in our right to live there. My feelings on the state of Israel itself are complicated but find that I disagree with its actions more than I agree with them. 

Now onto the post: I am constantly confused and flabbergasted by people, usually who are neither Jews nor Palestinians, who will do just about anything but admit that for many anti-Zionists, the goal is to kill or exile Jews from the levant.  Of course, there are some people who will outright admit this, but many people won’t. And when I mention it, I get responses like “why is that more important than what’s happening to Palestinians” (it’s not) and “why do you think decolonization = murder that says more about you as a colonizer than anything else”. Which like. Okay?

I’m not saying that every Palestinian or everyone who supports Palestine wants to kill or exile the Jews. But the truth is, many leaders within the movement either outright say this is what they want to do or they are just extremely vague about what happens to the Jews when we free Palestine. And then  Americans and Europeans get to pretend that concerns for Jewish safety aren’t valid. It is exhau"

The basic story is as follows: Alex and Bob don’t really like each other but they tolerate each other when they’re with each other. There is some petty drama between the two regarding birthday celebrations and balloons (the history of this drama isn’t really important) and there was an agreement that whenever there are birthday celebrations at Alex’s sauna in his house, there would be no balloons. Earlier this week was Alex’s birthday, the celebration was at his house, and there were balloons. I and 2 other people were a part of a conversation in the sauna where he complained about the balloons and how this is messed up, he then vulgarly insulted my grandmother because according to him she’s the one who bought the balloons. I told him not to say that as we were leaving the sauna and then repeated myself because I don’t think he heard me, he looked at me the 2nd time I said it but he didn’t respond to me.

I considered telling my grandpa about what Bob said about my grandma, but I wasn’t sure if it was permissible for me to do so. I’m sure this is going to be an “ask your rabbi” post, but wanted to hear other people’s opinion since I won’t be able to get an answer from my rabbi till motzei Shabbat. My purpose of telling my grandpa (or grandma) is for the honor of my grandma, whether Bob will be allowed in the Sauna or not anymore is up to my grandpa, but that’s not what concerns me. Also, this will probably create more fighting between the two sides of the family because Bob is Alex’s nephew’s father in law.  Would love to hear people’s opinions on the matter, thank you and Shabbat Shalom!"

Wise isn't an option in israel. Rewire has a lot of bad reviews. Can't buy crypto in israel without paying a 3%+ fee so that's not an option either.

It didnt take long for me to wonder who the rich men north of Richmond are. Perhaps they are not exclusively NY members of the tribe. But it reminds me of QAnon ideas (or Lizard people ideas) where they are mixed with other elites. The lyrics go on talking about how they “control” everything. Including perhaps the value of your “dollar”.

At one point there is a clear reference to Epstein’s island.

At another point, poor obese people on welfare, eating a brown fudge cookie…while their struggles are a waste of your tax dollars, from Anthony’s perspective, those of “young men” and people like “me and you” are more important. While he is careful not to mention young *white* men, I think it is evident where this goes. 

Anyone else think it is a white supremacist conspiracy theory that happens to involve Jews either primarily or in concert with other “Rich Men North of Richmond” controlling everything and responsible for people’s struggles?

Or am I totally paranoid?

The lyrics:

“

""Rich Men North Of Richmond""

I've been sellin' my soul, workin' all day
Overtime hours for bullshit pay
So I can sit out here and waste my life away
Drag back home and drown my troubles away

It's a damn shame what the world's gotten to
For people like me and people like you

Lord knows they all just wanna have total control
Wanna know what you think, wanna know what you do
And they don't think you know, but I know that you do
'Cause your dollar ain't shit and it's taxed to no end
'Cause of rich men north of Richmond

I wish politicians would look out for miners
And not just minors on an island somewhere
Lord, we got folks in the street, ain't got nothin' to eat
And the obese milkin' welfare

Well, God, if you're 5-foot-3 and you're 300 pounds
Taxes ought not to pay for your bags of fudge rounds
Young men are puttin' themselves six feet in the ground
'Cause all this damn country does is keep on kickin' them down

Lord, it's a damn shame what the world's gotten to
For people like me and people like you
Wish I could just wake up and it not be true
But it is, oh, it is

Livin' in the new world
With an old soul
These rich men north of Richmond
Lord knows they all just wanna have total control
Wanna know what you think, wanna know what you do
And they don't think you know, but I know that you do
'Cause your dollar ain't shit and it's taxed to no end
'Cause of rich men north of Richmond

I've been sellin' my soul, workin' all day
Overtime hours for bullshit pay”

The first is that they're corrupt - this is just an objective fact. The second reason is that they're pretty much useless because the settlement expansion has only increased. Most Palestinians see them as enablers of the Israeli occupation/settlements actually.

So what does the PA do to prove that they're on their side? They give money to anyone that gets killed by the IDF. Maybe I am wrong but I believe the martyrs fund is also for bystanders who've been killed. For example, the autistic man in Jerusalem that was innocent (IDF admits that and they were on edge when it happened) but was shot to death."

Recently though they’ve become kinda… militant. Posting a lot of stuff about how Palestine sound reclaim the land all the way to the sea, how Krav Maga is a “tool of state sanctioned anti-Palestinian violence”, stuff like that.

I have my issues with the Israeli government but I still believe in a two state solution and in striving for peace. I don’t hate anyone or wish for harm to come to anyone. 

Am I being paranoid or over the top in seeing these comments by my friend as… anti semitic? I know it’s kinda cliche to pull that card whenever Israel or Palestine are mentioned, but the comments have been making me increasingly uncomfortable."

(I'm not sure where exactly they are in the process).  I'm American (USA), and soon to be returning to Thailand for my master's degree.

 I know it's been a little isolating for them, as bangkok is very buddhist, with a small but visible muslim minority, and it doesn't seem like any of their friends particularly care about their conversion. At times they've told me I'm the only non-jew they talk about this stuff with, although I find it intensely interesting to see judaism through their eyes--they have had to really go out of their way to carve out an identity, whereas I am from Cincinnati and am going into psychodynamic psychotherapy--both of which are chock full of jews. Sort of like a fish and water, jews being around (whether that be in terms of physical proximity or influence on the intellectual domains I'm into ) is so regular to me that I never thought to take much note of it. Therefore I know pressingly little about judaism, and wouldn't have the first clue about what a good gift to get somebody would be.

1,2023-09-09,A 2 state solution is both immoral and inhumane.,u/Leonides2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/16e8z21/a_2_state_solution_is_both_immoral_and_inhumane/,"# A 2SS solution will never work.

Lately, there has been an increase in those who believe that Palestine should accept the ""deal of the century"": The proposed framework that gives formal recognition to a puppet state of Palestine - bearing the land of the West Bank, Gaza, and not Jerusalem- under the condition that this supposed state and its citizens give up their claim on the rest of Palestine from Haifa to ʻAkkā.

This 2SS solution has no place in reality. It claims Palestine should be recognized as a democratic state, but if any party, right or left, dares promote what could count as a threat to Israel; then expect nothing less than a military invasion that shall terrorize the Palestinian citizens until they give up their right to freedom; as shall be the fate of any democratic state in Palestine that dare not let their people be plundered and squeezed dry by the ""Israeli"" regime.

Nevertheless, this 2SS is nothing more than a morality sprinkle to the current reality. The reality that this bastard of a regime called ""Israel"" is the DeFacto ruler of historical Palestine, and degrades its once native citizens - in Palestine or outside it - through sanctions and constant bombing like that in Gaza; forced settlement and house demolishments like that in the West Bank; or by isolating them and forcing them into minority status - and I don't think I need to tell a jew what it means to be a minority- like what they did, and are doing, to 48' Palestinians.  

&#x200B;

# The actual purpose of the 2SS

The 2SS proposes itself as a peace option that hopes to please both sides by giving sovereignty to the Palestinians; as if the only way to have your country recognized is with unconditional surrender to the enemy.

Yes, the Oslo records and the deal of the century want peace, and yet it wants a peace deal where we are plundered and squeezed dry; it wants a peace deal where they achieve formal recognition of this oppression and submission; it wants peace where colonization becomes not only a legal act but a moral one.

But seldom will we let those tyrants define morality. Seldom will we turn our honorable martyrs into land thieves. Seldom will we negotiate our right to resist those savage colonizers.

&#x200B;

# The Enemies of nature 

Israel is the enemy of nature. Zionist hopes to break nature by introducing the only regime on earth that grants citizenship based on which god your mother believed but forbids this same right to the people who had homes in those lands, again, because of their religion.

Israel, the enemy of nature, hopes to vandalize nature by introducing an iron wall so large it will break the will of the native population to resist its colonizers.

Israel, couldn't you just leave in peace? 

But it seems we shall not be left in peace. 

Oppression and persecution cannot exterminate us. To the enemies of nature, Allah Akbar (God is greater), nature is greater.

Hard as you may try to challenge nature, justice shall prevail; for the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice; for as mighty as you might get, God will stay on our side.

And today, inspired by nothing but the quest for truth, I have drawn this conclusion: the only plausible solution is the destruction of this plague regime from our territories. While I hope that the Israelis will come to realize this and save us time; it is a given that blood alone moves the wheels of history.

So my understanding:

Prior to the absorption of the Irgun into the IDF, the Altalena leaves Europe for Israel bearing weapons intended for Irgun use. As the irgun becomes part of the IDF, Menachem Begin informs Ben Gurion of the shipment and they enter talks on what to do with the armaments. They agree to send it to a beach outside of Tel Aviv, and that 20% of the arms should go to the Jerusalem front. Begin wants some arms to go to the poorly armed former Irgun troops, Ben Gurion doesn’t and they agree to disagree.

When it comes to the unloading, Ben Gurion’s staff informs Begin that they will have to undertake the unloading alone, but some Palmach men are sent to assist. Some lorries to help carry arms are promised but not delivered. 

Begin and his men are allowed to reach the beach and then find themselves surrounded by the IDF. Ben Gurion orders the ship to be shelled, including targetting men trying to escape the flaming vessel.

The current judicial reform is completely halted until the next Knesset, all current political parties send a representative for **good faith** negotiations/discussion on how to do the judicial reform correctly, with guarantees from all parties that they will implement the result of the וועדה i The next Knesset regardless of who won the elections


The reason I ask it, because I am personally torn by the whole situation, I think that the judicial reform is needed, and a supreme courts that answers to no one is completely undemocratic, while I also think that changes in the way the Israeli democracy works should only be implemented when both sides of the political spectrum agree, and the way it is done now is absolutely disgusting and undemocratic"

It was something I should not have paid any mind to but I was guilty of believing this .

I am wondering if anyone wants to see some of the way the results look like here? Where let's say I don't have the genes I think I might, it can stop these ill advised sayings or rumours even.

What would be a good way to share some of the results without exposing my identity? If it can help ease anyone's concern Jews have like some weird genes, I want to do this for the community. For reference, I was a baby model and never looked out of the ordinary ... people say I should have had kids but for a variety of reasons, I decided the genes had to just end with me and I am cool with this."

1,2023-09-09,interfaith bris?,u/Over-Location-6466,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/16efchi/interfaith_bris/,"Has anyone here had a bris when half the family was not jewish, and the jewish side isn't very observant.

(I'm going to use the abbreviation circ for the word because I've discovered there are people on reddit who search for the whole word and come attack people for it)

My husband has a jewish mother, and a christian/agnostic father. He grew up celebrating jewish holidays mostly and didn't do anything with christian holidays except extended family Christmas/Easter on his dad's side. He sort of calls himself jew-ish.

I'm chinese american. I basically was just raised with no religion. The concept of circ isn't something that's foreign to me since honestly my boyfriends in college all had it done before I met my husband. Apparently it's not done in china, which makes me wonder about my parents' thoughts on it, but I don't have a brother so they likely never had to think about this.

My husband and I had decided we are going to choose circ for our son mostly for health reasons and american society reasons and then his mom proposed the concept of having a bris. It turns out my husband had a bris when he was born. He actually didn't even know he had a bris until this conversation happened actually.

His mom's thoughts are that if our son wanted to do something with his jewish side when he's older it'd be better if he had the bris but I'm not jewish and my husband isn't really that observant as its more culture for him.

So...curious about thoughts I guess. I did some searching around and apparently there is a mohel in our area (new word for me) who is also a pediatrician who often takes care of kind of distantly jewish families like ours. I know we don't really meet the standards for being officially jewish. My husband's mom is basically thinking if the circ is happening, why not have a bris as opposed to having the hospital do it since whats the harm? For me I'm just thinking its one thing to have it as a medical procedure but inviting my family would that be potentially complicated. 

Anyway, curious what experiences others have had with this type of situation."

The opioid crisis destroyed lives and families across the United States, even in the Jewish community.  This recent decision to expand access to things like Narcan is vital to fighting this crisis. If you think you may be in a situation where you may need Narcan accessible, whether it's for you, a family member, a friend, or a stranger, I highly recommend having some. Also, depending on where you live, some cities have programs where you can pick up free Narcan at public buildings like libraries.  Harm reduction is so important in fighting the opioid crisis and addiction generally.  "

People from the outside think our life involves being racist and daily segregating people, causing  innocent people to be scared to say “I think my people deserve a country”. The history of the Jews goes way back and it’s only fair for them to have their own country, this has nothing to do with Palestine also. The current location of Israel was chosen because it is where they descended from. I don’t agree with a lot of governmental things, I am also not involved, but after being called a child killer for simply being a Jew (at the time I wasn’t pro Israel at all), I have realized how much this proves that Jews need Israel, a place to feel safe. Jews contribute a lot to literally every industry so it’s not like they are irrelevant. And although people claim the military is violent, it is still less violent then what I see some normal refugee citizens do in Europe and be forgiven crime after crime (I live in Germany). So why do I need to be so scared and hesitant when all I really want is just to not hide my identity? I am proud to be who I am and it took many years of self hating to realize, I am not a bad person, and there is nothing wrong with me as long as I respect others opinions and stay non violent, I don’t see anything wrong with having this opinion!"

In Israel (I am an Israeli Yemenite Jew) it is very visible- how can a brown skinned Arab looking Jew like myself, a Ginger blue eyed Jew from Russia, and an Ethiopian Jew be all decendents from the same ethnic group? We all share the same Jewish identity that was formed in the ancient Jewish kingdom, but It is clear to me that while Jews successfully passed Jewish traditions through generations, the share of Levantine genes was diminished over time due to conversion and intermarriages to the point that the Israeli Jewish society is visibly one of the most genetically diverse societies on earth. This is the reason whenever I see people justify Zionism by claims of genetic continuity I feel somewhat uncomfortable. Instead, we should rather focus on continuity of traditions originated from the Land of Israel to demonstrate our rights and connection to the land. Meaning, we should regard our gentile ancestors and their decendents as ""naturalized citizens"" of the Jewish nation that inherited the rights to the land from the original exiled Jews by adopting their culture and traditions, including the aspiration to renew Jewish sovereignty in the birthplace of the Jewish people.

 these are the most relevant parts. You can get them into Google Translate if you don't know Hebrew. 

בשנות ה-60 של המאה הקודמת החלו להתבצע מחקרים גנטיים בקרב יהודים, בזרם שהלך וגבר ככל שהתפתחה הביולוגיה המולקולרית. הנחת היסוד של המחקרים הללו היתה שהיהודים הם קבוצה עם חותם גנטי משותף. עד כה לא נמצא להנחה הזאת אישוש מדעי.





הן הגישה הסוציולוגית ואנתרופולוגית והן מחקרים בגנטיקה אבולוציונית חוברים לסברה שיהודי התפוצות השונות הם קבוצה ששמרה לאורך אלפי השנים על מסורת דומה אך התקשתה לשמור על המשכיות גנטית חזקה, עקב השפעות דמוגרפיות חיצוניות משמעותיות כפי שהוזכר. מכאן נובע השוני בחזותם של יהודים מתפוצות שונות.



On the other hand: 

ככלל, המחקרים האלו תומכים בתפיסה המסורתית שלפיה קהילות היהודים בעולם מקורן באוכלוסיות ישראליות קדומות שהוגלו. הממצאים גם סותרים את התיאוריות שלפיהן מקורה של יהדות אשכנז הם גויים שקיבלו על עצמם את מצוות היהדות בתהליך גיור המוני. כמו כן עולה מהם שמקורו של העם היהודי על כל תפוצותיו הוא ככל הנראה באוכלוסייה שחייתה לפני כמה אלפי שנים באזור הלבנט – המזרח התיכון, ובפרט החלק המערבי של אזור הסהר הפורה"

Basically they say there shouldn't be a Palestinian state because then minorities (LGBT) or women are going to be persecuted. Why does this confuse me? well because it sounds like the people who say this think Israel controls the Palestinian parts of the West Bank. 

I remember watching a video by Corey Gil Shuster where he was in Ramallah. Some of the comments were like: ""If these girls were in a Muslim country, they wouldn't be allowed to shop and wear makeup"" when Ramallah is under the Palestinian Authority. 

I think this mainly comes from non-Israelis. Ask any Israeli why they don't want to leave the WB and it has nothing to do with protecting gay rights.

We Bnei Yisrael regardless of our opinions have to be unity in being proud Jews and observing the mitzvot that we can and to add what we can when we can. But most importantly the hakhel when we all come together man women and children young and old. We all stayed united while listening to the Torah to better improve our relationships with each other and with nature. From the highest person in society to the lowest in society are the same in the eyes of Hashem and that we have to come together in our different ways. And that we should all agree to improve ourselves so that we don't see towards one another so that on Yom Kippur we are blameless because we haven't wronged each other or wronged nature but that we helped build each other.

He was always a pretty devout Jew growing up, so I wasn't surprised at all that he was active in Chabad in college and grad school and married a Jewish woman who he met there. I was surprised to see that not only have he and his wife since converted to Catholicism and are devout Catholics to the extent that they teach Sunday school at their parish but also that they continue to actively donate money to (and perhaps otherwise be involved in?) Chabad. A more secular Jewish organization I could see, because they are still Jewish ethnically and culturally, but given that Chabad's whole mission is encouraging Jews to be more devoutly Jewish, I was surprised that someone would convert away from Judaism and become a devout Christian but continue to give money to Chabad. Is there a more secular part of Chabad that I'm unaware of?"

I do have a few close friends but our conversations never address my problem. And I have three grown children with whom I am close. But they are living their own lives and that is as it should be. I can’t stop thinking about how miserable the next few years will be until I am gone through some disease or an accident or whatever.

I don't see any connection between what Palestinian civilians go through and these three. Mike Brown was shot after robbing an immigrant store clerk and then trying to kill a cop. Trayvon Martin started pummeling a Hispanic guy who was carrying a gun. George Floyd was high on fentanyl and being arrested for passing a foraged bill and died due to excess force by the police while trying to arrest him. Palestinian civilians are innocent. That's not to say I agree with the shooting of Martin or the excessive force by the police that killed Floyd. But it seems like an over reach and exploitation of the Palestinian cause to link these three killings in the US to what the Palestinians go through. Totally apples and oranges.

I have recently discovered that my great grandmother was jewish. Our understanding is that once she fled Europe, she was understandably experiencing a traumatic situation (WW2 - we have not been able to trace our family back past her so her family may have been lost to the Holocaust) and so my grandfather was not raised with knowledge of his being jewish. Either that or he made the decision (I would guess potentially also from that traumatic situation) to not make his children (my mother included) aware - I can’t ask as he has passed away my only knowledge on this is he has always been very resistant to any documentation or exploration of family trees. My understanding is traditionally I would not be considered Jewish as my mothers mother was not also Jewish. Discovering this information and the potential trauma around it/it’s suppression in the family has made me feel quite sad and as if my mother/grandfather missed out on their culture, and obviously I feel pained at my great grandmothers experience… part of me wishes I could reconnect to this side of my family or wishes I had been able to know about this earlier. Has anyone here had a similar experience? I’d assume conversion would be required to become practicing or explore actively, and if so I’d be curious to hear your experiences. Again apologies I have no cultural knowledge of Judaism and could be completely wrong in my assumptions here. Happy to hear any responses!"

He is my only biological parent as I was conceived via anonymous egg donor and a separate womb donor in which either could be Jewish and I would never know.

My father is a Jew via his maternal grandmother, a Croatian Jew and native Yiddish speaker, whom immigrated to the US and had my grandma. My grandmother got to hold me once after I was born, but died shortly after due to old age.

I never got to meet her or learn anything from her which has left me kind of empty in regards to my identity. To make things more conflicting for me, my dad looks very ethnically Jewish, with curly dark hair, dark eyes, and olive skin, in which he inherited from his mother. And I also received a good amount of those Jewish genes.

I identify strongly with my Jewish heritage as it's the only thing I really have. I don't identify with my other half genetically because it's simply not mine to identify with. But then there's the issue of it being my father whose Jewish. Even though I don't have a mother figure in my life and there's no way of me knowing if my egg donor or womb donor was Jewish, but it would be funny if they were.

I want to learn more about Judaism and be proud and outward about my heritage. I don't want to let my families history end with me. But would I be in the wrong to?  


I'll elaborate on things as requested. My situation is unique and I appreciate all of your responses, thank you!"

So some people around the Mediterranean were aware, at least in vague terms, of Buddhism or Sramana traditions from India. **But do we know how common was this knowledge in general?

While the halakhic differences between the sepharadim vs the askenazim is a well known and interesting topic, I was wondering if there were also any differences in Kabbalistic/Mystical traditions/stories/interpretations? If so don't es anyone have any examples? I don't know much about this but would love to learn more if such differences existed. I appreciate that the differences might not be as clear cut as differences in halakha, but I would find this interesting none the less. Thanks friends, wishing you all the very best."

I had always assumed they eat the type of foods you might typically order at a Jewish deli (obviously not in the massive portion sizes), probably because that’s the only type of food I had seen specifically labeled as ‘Jewish’. So this would mean lots of cold cut sandwiches, various types of breads, soups, interesting types of fish, etc. He said that other than bagels they didn’t really eat much of that, some special things around the holidays but pretty much like typical non-ethnic white American non-Jews all other times (and to be fair I don’t even know what most typical white Americans eat at home on a daily basis but that’s a whole other discussion!)"

Below scriptures seem to indicate iciate Ramoth belonged to the tribe of Manasseh.

Joshua 20:8
Beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they appointed Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau, from the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in the Bashan, from the tribe of Manasseh.

Joshua 17:1–2
Then the allotment was made for the tribe of Manasseh, because he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Makir, the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a warrior. 2 An allotment was made for the remaining descendants of Manasseh, according to their families: For the children of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida—these were the male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph according to their families.

Deuteronomy 3:13
And the remainder of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, the whole region of Argob. All of that area of Bashan was called the land of the Rephaim.

Below gives off the impression Ramoth belonged to the tribe of Gad. 

1 Kings 4:13
Ben-Geber was in Ramoth-Gilead; the villages of Jair, the son of Manasseh which are in the Gilead were his, and the region of Argob which is in the Bashan, sixty great cities, with walls having crossbars of bronze, were his.

Deuteronomy 4:43 
He set apart Bezer in the wilderness in the land of the plateau of the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead of the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan of the Manassites

Joshua 21:38
From the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead, the city of refuge for the killer, and its pasturelands, Mahanaim and its pasturelands

Deuteronomy 3:12
And so we took possession of this land at that time, from Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi of Arnon, and also half of the hill country of Gilead and its towns I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.

This one seems to suggest Ramoth belonged to Issachar

1 Chronicles 6:72–73
Out of the tribe of Issachar: Kedesh with its pasturelands, Daberath with its pasturelands, Ramoth with its pasturelands, and Anem with its pasturelands"

However, as I delve deeper into my exploration, I believe it's essential to gain a more comprehensive understanding. Every culture has its strengths and challenges, and I'd like to learn about both sides.

In the spirit of respectful inquiry, I'd appreciate it if members of the Jewish community or those familiar with Jewish culture could share their insights. What are some of the strengths and positive aspects of Jewish culture that you admire or find valuable? At the same time, are there any challenges or drawbacks that you believe are worth discussing?

I approach this topic with an open mind and the utmost respect for cultural diversity. I believe that understanding both the strengths and challenges of a culture contributes to a richer and more nuanced perspective.

What I can’t wrap my head around is how people can claim Judaism without following major things like halachic modesty laws, the tattoo thing, being in a same sex relationship, etc.

All of these things apply to me. So i don’t believe i would be accepted in an orthodox environment. Or i think i would just feel like an imposter because i am not the image of a perfectly religious Jew.

As an Argentinian I was always exposed to judaism in buenos aires but my journey into being more intrigued by it is recent. This journey started after visiting a friend in Israel this past summer but I digress. 

Anyways, this story begins with me wandering the campus of my college a few days ago and getting harassed for the second time in a week by the local “bible study group” evangelicals hounding every passerby to join their group. After having politely declined their offer, they kept hounding (which was a repeat of the earlier encounter) and I just said “I’m sorry but you won’t get far, I personally find more value in the teachings of judaism, please go away.” 

Mayhem ensued. The guy doubles down and insists that there will be value in me reading the bible with him and I politely decline again and say “I’m comfortable with what I believe, but thanks.” This sent him into a rage and he said “Well what you believe is a dead faith!”. I was in shock because this is supposed to be a diverse university in southern california, if saying not even that I am jewish but that I am interested more in it than christianity elicits this reaction… I guess I first hand saw what my Jewish friends here in LA have been living for far too long (and this pales in comparison to other stories).

I responded after the initial shock at the comment passed with “If that’s what you believe that’s fine, but don’t push it on me. This campus is not the place to harass people and you can’t just talk to people like this.”
Which gave him the opening to say “It’s not what I believe, it’s the truth. You’ll find out some day soon”.

 What the fuck? Anyways I walked off and reported him. thankfully counseling and campus police intervened with the guy, he’s forbidden from participating in bible club now or whatever (should’ve been expelled imo). 

Not only do I want to warn other people in LA about these kinds of things by posting this, but also what is a “dead faith” supposed to even be? I want to be extra on the lookout for anti-semitic dog whistles and think this may be one. At least the faith seems alive and well in Jerusalem from when I was there just 2 months ago!

The rabbi instructed the person to walk up a mountain with a feather pillow, slit the pillow to let the feathers out, and then to go and collect all the feathers.

I support the end of Israeli military rule over any part of the Palestinian territories captured in the Six Day War. This rule will be ideally replaced either with a sovereign independent Palestinian state or a single secular democratic state covering the entire land (assuming that both sides agree to it). That said, I can't help but notice that many ordinary Palestinians and members of Palestinian militant organizations are not really motivated by democratic values. Rather, they are more often than not motivated by exclusionary Palestinian Arab nationalism, Islamism, and anti-Semitism. The fact that according to recent polls, a large percentage of Palestinians support ""armed struggle"" against Israel over a negotiated two state solution doesn't bode well. The fact that it looks like Hamas would win over Fatah in the West Bank if fair elections were held doesn't bode well. The fact that according to the ADL's anti-Semitism survey, almost every Palestinian (93%) agree with six or more blatantly anti-Semitic statements ([https://global100.adl.org/country/west-bank-and-gaza/2014](https://global100.adl.org/country/west-bank-and-gaza/2014)) doesn't bode well. How can Israelis be expected to make important concessions necessary for peace if the other side is chalk full of anti-Semites and Islamists who want to make the entire land an Islamic Palestinian Arab state? This problem of bigotry can only be addressed internally by the Palestinians themselves. No one else can make the overwhelming majority of Palestinians adopt attitudes conducive to peace.

You are a frum therapist, who is seeing a frum female (or male) client. The client shares how they are very displeased in their marriage and is considering cheating on their spouse. Medicine and ethics aside, take a look at it from a Halachic lens. As a frum therapist what do you do?

Wtf. There are plenty of Jews who are not Israelian and don't agree with how Israel is handling the situation in there. It would be like accusing all Muslims in the world of agreeing with the Bataclan assault! And the bit about being rich and greedy is just more old, harmful stereotypes. 

It was honestly baffling, these friends are usually the definition of acceptance and open mindedness. They will speak against racism with conviction and act against it.

נשמע מורכב? אז נפשט את זה. דמי הריבית הם הכסף שאתה משלם על הסכומים שלך כאשר אתה משתמש בהלוואה או זוכה לרווח על הפקדה בבנק. המחשבון ריבית דריבית עוזר לך לחשב כמה כסף יהיה לך בסופו של תקופה מסוימת או כמה תשלם על ההלוואה שלך בסופה.

הרעיון הוא להזין נתונים כמו הסכומים המקוריים, שער הריבית וזמן ההשקעה או ההלוואה, והמחשבון מחשב לך את התוצאות. בכך אפשר לקבוע את האפשרויות הפיננסיות שלך ולהכין תכנית לחיסכון או השקעה מול המידע הזה.

> We the undersigned, Palestinian academics, writers, artists, activists, and people of all walks of life, unequivocally condemn the morally and politically reprehensible comments made by President of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas about the Holocaust

And went on to say 

> The Palestinian people are sufficiently burdened by Israeli settler colonialism, dispossession, occupation, and oppression without having to bear the negative effect of such ignorant and profoundly antisemitic narratives perpetuated by those who claim to speak in our name. 

Obviously, no Palestinian statement is complete without claims of Israeli ""apartheid"", but still, this is a welcome statement and good advice for all pro-Palestine individuals. Anti-Semitic narratives like Abbas' statements have a negative effect on the Palestinian people. 

As for who signed the letter, most of them were people I had never heard of, and I follow the conflict more than the average person. However, there were some notable names, such as Noura Erekat and Yousef Munayyer. 

However, far more prominent and influential Palestinian activists Ali Abunimah and Mohammed El-Kurd refused to sign this letter. Why? They can tell you themselves.

> [Ali](https://twitter.com/AliAbunimah/status/1701132659408191578): ""With all respect for some signatories, I won't add my name to the ""open letter"" about Mahmoud Abbas. It's not the job of Palestinians to apologize for the words of the collaborator imposed and funded by the Zionists and their US/EU accomplices to oppress the Palestinian people. Abbas's offensive words were just that: words — whereas his crimes against the Palestinian people: murder, torture, imprisonment, betrayal of the resistance, have never been condemned by his US/EU and Israeli masters, on the contrary they fund him to do that. Moroever, for Palestinians to address Abbas in any way, even in condemnation, is to implicitly recognize him and take collective responsibility for him, which is not ours. Nor will an ""open letter"" in English, appease or impress his Zionist masters and our other enemies.

> And [Mohammed](https://twitter.com/m7mdkurd/status/1701060314882531833): ""I’m astonished that the one time we write a joint statement condemning Mahmoud Abbas, it’s to condemn his senile ramblings about the Jews. Not his collaboration w/the Zionist regime, not the brutalization of protesters & political prisoners, & not even the murder of Nizar Banat. If we’re in agreement that Abbas is a subcontractor for the occupation, why are we obliged to disown him? Since when does the PA represent our People? Why must we always be on the defense against baseless accusations? Why do our grievances w/ our oppressors require disclaimers?"" 

So their narrative is set. Abbas is a ""collaborator"" who represents no one but himself and is in fact an ""oppressor"" of the Palestinian people. Once again, the Palestinian narrative contradicts itself, [proving its incoherence and lack of basis in reality.](https://reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/13xgrpo/its_impossible_to_reason_with_propalestine/) Two of the most prominent pro-Palestinian voices refuse to consider Mahmoud Abbas to be the representative of the Palestinians, as most people do. 

El-Kurd asks ""Since when does the PA represent our People""? I would instead ask him, and any pro-Palestinian person who has the guts to answer, if not the PA, then who? Who represents the Palestinians? 

It's about time Palestinian society confronted the hate at the heart of its government and resolved both the hate and the shell game that is who represents them. I for one am getting tired of hearing the narrative that Abbas represents the Palestinians when he says he wants peace but not when he makes anti-Semitic statements like the ones last week. "

Very troubling study showing the prevalence of antisemitism among very educated people. The original study is a bit hard to find, but you can find it if you do a Google Scholar search for the authors.

What jumped out at me was the question about banning gatherings during COVID. Among people with **graduate degrees**, the number of respondents who thought Orthodox Jewish funerals should have been prohibited was 36 percentage points *higher* than those who thought BLM protests should have been prohibited. That's absolutely crazy when you think about the actual difference between the two gatherings from a public health risk perspective."

1,2023-09-11,"When attending YJP events (like JCC or Chabad), how do you talk to multiple people/women who are friends with each other (and you don’t know anyone)?",u/proforrange,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/16fwq3q/when_attending_yjp_events_like_jcc_or_chabad_how/,"So I just moved back to NYC after a long hiatus. A lot of my friends who used to live here no longer do, so I’m virtually starting everything all over again. Trying to both make friends and find relationships at this point. Which may be conflicting goals and I should just pick one when going to these.

The problem is….everyone is in groups and a lot of people seem to know each other fairly well. I awkwardly fumble into conversations while others are talking to each other….but that’s the only way I can meet new people. It’s very intimidating.

The other thing that’s very intimidating is often I get asked at events (particularly from people who skew Sephardic for some reason) ‘what’s your ethnicity’ before even my name…and I don’t know if I’m ashkenaz or Sephardic. They get really rude when I say that it doesn’t matter to me and for me I get flashbacks of Yeshiva when I got bullied for that reason…so that’s another barrier I have.

I only have 1 close Jewish friend here. Which is great! It’s better than none and very appreciative that I’m back home again…but I’m not sure how to broach making more (he doesn’t like going to events because he equally feels intimidated by them so I go solo).

Long and short I guess I have a couple questions:

1) Anyone have any advice on how to best ‘mesh in’ to a group when you don’t know anyone (and not look like there’s something wrong with you)?

2) Would any YJPs living in NY here be willing to connect offline to either just grab coffee and chat or be a wing at the next event they go to? It would be a heck of a lot easier if I had people who could vouch I’m a decent dude to be around and not just a weirdo bearded Jew nomad :)"

Bios written/submitted by the subjects.

* [/u/mstreiffer](https://www.reddit.com/u/mstreiffer) **\[Reform\]** \- I'm a Reform rabbi, ordained at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. I've served as a congregational rabbi for 16 years (most of it in Toronto but some in North Carolina). I run a virtual Beit Midrash (centre for Jewish learning) called LAASOK.org that brings together people who want to study Jewish texts in an inclusive, egalitarian environment.
* [u/sonoforwel](https://www.reddit.com/user/sonoforwel) **\[Conservative\]** \- I am a Conservative rabbi, ordained in 2014 at the Jewish Theological Seminary, where I also attained an MA in Talmud and Rabbinics. I served as Rabbi Educator of a small congregation in North-East Los Angeles, CA, and now teach Hebrew at a public middle school in Beverly Hills, CA, where I live with my wife and two kids. I grew up in Colombia, South America, and continue to work with mixed-language communities in Southern California.
* u/RabbiNover **\[Conservative\]** \- I am a Conservative Rabbi (Ordained At JTS in 2019). I also have an MA in Hebrew Bible, an MA in Jewish Education, A BA in Physics and a Graduate certificate in Israel Education. I am a pulpit rabbi, the main service leader and Torah reader at my congregation, director of a synagogue supplementary school program, and coordinator of the local, multi-denominational Intro to Judaism class. I love to teach about Judaism, and often introduce unconventional approaches, including everything from Jews and Zombies to Jews in Space to simply the Kashrut of eating locusts. I'm originally from Texas, went through a Conservative Hebrew School, and after a year of science research, teaching Science, and Jewish Study (all different pre-college programs) I knew I wanted to end up in Jewish Education.
* [u/dlevine21](https://www.reddit.com/user/dlevine21) **\[Pluralistic/Post-Denominational\]** \-  Shana Tova, My name is Daniel Levine and I'm currently a Rabbi in Irvine, California, working as the Campus Rabbi for Hillel and teaching in the Jewish Studies department at UC Irvine! My background is modern Orthodox - but I currently identify as post-denominational/pluralistic. I’m a frequent writer and podcaster and you can find my materials posted on Facebook and Instagram (just look up my name!). When not talking Judaism I’m an avid rock climber and mountaineer. AMA!
   * [Here is a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/igzotq/im_an_orthodox_raised_currently_pluralistic_rabbi/) to Rabbi Levine’s AMA
* [u/rabbifuente](https://www.reddit.com/user/rabbifuente) **\[Non-denominational/Traditional\]** \-  I grew up at a Reform synagogue in the Chicago suburbs. After years of independent study and learning with some wonderful Chabad rabbis I received smicha from a small, independent program out of New York in 2021. I would say I am a ""non-denominational"" rabbi, however I fall somewhere around Traditional/MO in terms of theology. I like to think that having grown up Reform and now being on the more traditional end of the spectrum gives me a certain perspective that many find helpful. Currently, I am focusing on small group/1:1 study and ""religious"" counseling. I am always more than happy to talk to anyone about Judaism, answer questions, etc. Outside of rabbinics, I am an avid bread baker and microbakery owner, cigar enthusiast, passionate home cook, and pickle snob.
* [u/SF2K01](https://www.reddit.com/user/SF2K01) **\[Orthodox\]** \-  Originally from Columbus, Ohio, I was exposed to a variety of denominations growing up, from Reform to Orthodox, before settling on Modern Orthodoxy as a teenager. I only attended public schools and went straight to college after high school, attended the University of Cincinnati and got my undergraduate degree in Jewish Studies. Afterwards, I spent 2 years in Israel learning in Shapell’s Darche Noam before coming to Yeshiva University for my graduate degree in Jewish History at Revel and achieved Rabbinic Ordination through YU’s Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, particularly with Rabbi Ezra Schwartz, Rabbi Dr. Jeremy Wieder, Dr. Steven Fine, Dr. Lawrence Schiffman, and Dr. Yaakov Elman. After completing my studies, I worked in outreach for a few years before pivoting to become a fundraiser for Jewish educational institutions. Aside from my Rabbinic and Academic interests, I am a longtime gamer, sci-fi and tech enthusiast, and reside in Washington Heights, Manhattan, with my wife, daughter, and two Siamese cats.
* [u/rebthor](https://www.reddit.com/user/rebthor) **\[Orthodox\]** \- I'm an Orthodox rabbi living in Queens, NY. I received my semicha from a yeshiva in Queens that's small enough that I would dox myself if I said the name. I also learned at Sh'or Yoshuv in 5TFR for little while. I grew up non-Orthodox in Buffalo, NY primarily in the Conservative movement and was very active in USY. I also was very close to the Chabad rabbis there and have a special place in my heart for Chabad although I don't identify as Lubavitch. I love learning halacha so my favorite rabbis are generally poskim; I often refer to the Aruch HaShulchan, R' Moshe Feinstein, Maran Ovadiah Yosef and the Tzitz Eliezer when trying to figure out what to do. I also am a big fan of the works of R' Jonathan Sacks and libadel R' Dovid Hofstedter. I have 4 children, a dog and a wife who has put up with me for near a quarter century. To pay the bills I work as a programmer. In my free time, I like to read, play video games, be disappointed by the Mets, Bills, Sabres and Tottenham and bake sourdough bread.
* [u/fullhauss](https://www.reddit.com/user/fullhauss) **\[Orthodox\]** \-  I grew up in the LA area, and was very involved in the Conservative movement. In college I shifted to Orthodoxy while obtaining a BA in Judaic Studies. After college, I spent two years studying at Shapell’s/Darche Noam before going to Yeshiva University to obtain my Smekha. I have worked at a Jewish day school and now work with college students on campus.
* u/Mottel **\[Orthodox (Chabad)\]** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/otzxvg/hi\_im\_mordechai\_lightstone\_a\_chabad\_rabbi\_for\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/otzxvg/hi_im_mordechai_lightstone_a_chabad_rabbi_for_the/)
* [u/NewYorkImposter](https://www.reddit.com/user/NewYorkImposter) **\[Orthodox (Chabad)\]** \- I'm Chabad-affiliated, but don't like labels due to the stigmas and assumptions that often come along with them. I have Chabad Smicha from Israel/Singapore which I got after completing post-highschool Yeshiva Gedolah in Melbourne and Crown Heights. I've previously hosted services in New Zealand and Sydney. I currently use my Smicha informally in informal outreach in the Australian film industry and the Sydney Jewish community (and occasionally on Reddit and Discord 😉).

1,2023-09-11,"Why do people consider it unacceptable (or just ignorant) to ever compare a Black person to a Nazi, while people get really really giddy about the chance to compare Jews to Nazis?",u/korach1921,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/16fzu6i/why_do_people_consider_it_unacceptable_or_just/,"A month ago, a friend sent me this video by F.D. Signifier, who's a prominent Black leftist Youtuber. I hadn't watched him a long time, but I remember really liking his content when he first started getting traction online. However, something in the video he said around the 19-minute mark really bothered me. He was discussing Louis Farrakhan and made a strange argument that Farrakhan's antisemitism is somehow completely different than the antisemitism of white racists. Here's what he says at 18:55.

>That in mind, I want to be clear though that Farrakhan's antisemitism and, say, Alex Jones' antisemitism that is traditionally white supremacist are not the same. They don't come from the same root causes, they don't have the same end goals. This is important to understand because I know a lot of you get all hot and bothered by the idea of finding a ""Blitler"" \[Black Hitler\] to content farm and will try to make lazy uninformed comparisons between these fringe Black ideologies and the mainstream White media news outlets that pedal the same thing. Both forms of antisemitism are harmful and deserve critique, but Alex Jones was a huge media figure for years before lawsuits finally took him down a few pegs just a couple years ago. Meanwhile, Farrakhan hasn't been on mainstream TV in over a decade and Tucker Carlson who is still putting out antisemitic nonesense is the most watched news anchor in all of American TV. These two things are not the same...

Aside from being super incoherent (they're not the same because Farrakhan doesn't get media coverage anymore?), why is this even an argument? You would never say that a Jewish person's antiblackness is somehow different than a gentile's antiblackness. This seems to imply that antisemitism is a product of white supremacy, rather than it's own thing that developed parallel to it, but is still separate, and that victims of white supremacy don't engage with it the same way. How does Farrakhan not have the same ""end goal"" or ""root causes"" of his view of Jews as a conspiratorial, international clique?

Either way, this brought up a lot of vague memories I have from being on twitter not too long time ago, where people would scold other people for ever comparing a black antisemite to a Nazi, or trying to find connections between Pan-Africanists, Black nationalists/separatists, etc and antisemitic ideology. The very idea that Black people could ever be fascists or even just racists was inherently heretical.

BUT, these were often the same people who would jump at any opportunity to compare a racist, right-wing, or ultra-Zionist Jew to a Nazi, and seemed to get a lot of weird pleasure out of it. The idea that Israel is completely equivalent to Nazi Germany, which I think was a common talking point on the German new left in the 1960s.

Just rubs me the wrong way."

I started dating my Jewish boyfriend in college and met a lot of Jews through him. He's now my husband but he was not raised in the faith.

At that time (over a decade ago) I became interested in learning more about the faith.

I did for a little bit but nothing long term ever came from it.

Just in the last two weeks I've all of a sudden had a strong inkling to just study more about Christianity and Judaism as a whole.

I've really resonated with Judaism and what I've read these last few weeks and want to continue to explore it more.

Should I reach out to a local synagogue and put my interest to explore forth, or should I try and do online learning first?

This is not a troll post, I am legitimately interested in exploring more. I have been doing research for the last few weeks but know person-to-person interactions are needed.

I have not ruled out that one day I may want to pursue conversion.

Appreciate any insight!

P.S. - I know the High Holidays are coming, so if I do reach out, it wouldn't be for a month and a half or so. I know Rabbis and congregations will be busy and I respect that!"

This new coalition is bothersome .. with the passing of the reasonableness law, the new efforts of judicial reform they’re trying to pass, law of return amendments they’ve considered doing. I had some questions for my Israeli brethren if I may, and please try to answer with your most unbiased prediction;


1.) Do you think this coalition will collapse and trigger a re-election? I saw an article posted recently regarding as to how there are four (& maybe more) Likud MKs who May vote ‘no’ on the coming judicial reform legislation, wouldn’t that trigger a collapse since Ben-Gvir & his followers will quit working for not getting what they want? 

2.) Do you think the Judicial reforms will go through?

3.) If an election is triggered, do you foresee Bibi winning again?

4.) Do you think that the Law of Return regarding the potential removal of the grandchild clause and the potential removal of recognition for converts of no previous Jewish background in Reform or Conservative Judaism will go through?


I think if any of the above continues it’ll completely destroy relations between Israel & the diaspora, or at least severe ties in many ways, financially. 


I don’t personally think the coalition is going to last much longer. My dad is a Jew & I love Judaism, I don’t want to see Israel ruin itself from internal issues …."

We might never know the answer to this question (so little historical information about these sages have been preserved), but the reason I'm asking this is because I'm trying to figure out how the different schools of Shammai and Hillel came to be. If Shammai was older than Hillel then I was thinking about reconstructing the following scenario: Shammai, most likely situated in Israel at the time (Shammai's place of origin is not known for sure), was a very influential Rabbi attracting a lot of students. Hillel comes up from Babylon, and gains ascendency over the [family of Betheira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bnei_Bathyra) and is appointed Nasi (Hillel may have been more suitable for the job than Shammai, either because of his personality, or because he was from the davidic line). Hillel starts to attract a school of his own, but Shammai is not ready to yield his rabbinical power to Hillel, thus two schools are formed, although Hillel accepts Shammai into his own court. Shammai still remains the de facto rabinnical authority in Israel as is evidenced from Shabbos 17a (""Hillel sat submissively before Shammai""), only later does the school of Hillel gain ascendency over Shammai.

How likely is such a scenario? Is there any evidence that Shammai was older than Hillel?"

My grandfather and my dad didn't hunt, but for sport they would do skeet shooting and go to the range. When I was old enough to purchase my own firearm for everyday carrying, it felt like a huge goal that I reached. As time went on, and I became more religious, the halacha involved left me feeling confused. I want to be that Jew nobody messes with, but...is there a doubt of faith in that, or, does Hashem want us to step up when Never Again means we don't lay down like sheep to the slaughter. Now we have the IDF and Mossad diligently maintaining order in Israel, with many of them Haredim. What about us in the diaspora? While in the US we have a total right to carry a firearm for self defense, are we really just asking for trouble? I carry a concealed firearm, sometimes an open carry firearm, and where it once felt like the right thing to do, I'm becoming conflicted in my old age. Hashem is supposed to provide protection for myself and my family. But Hashem has also given me the ability to learn KM and how to handle a firearm for self defense. For now, it stays in my safe on shabbos. But I'm thinking maybe it's time to consider just keeping it in the safe all the time.

I dunno. It's a polarizing topic. I'm just curious if there's other religious Jews who struggle with the same thoughts."

The Haredim in particular have hyperconservative and controlling views. They have cult-like features. You can see an example of this in this video: [https://www.reddit.com/r/israel/submit?source\_id=t3\_16fuey0](https://www.reddit.com/r/israel/submit?source_id=t3_16fuey0) 

&#x200B;

Unsurprisingly, the Haredim were among the most anti-vax in both New York and Israel. They are basically the Jewish equivalent of MAGA, unlike most Jews who usually rank about as high as agnostics and atheists in terms of progressive views, notably on homosexuality. They are pretty much the opposite of what is called ""WEIRD"" (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic). 

&#x200B;

They also have a high birth rate, low economic/military participation, high economic dependency and vote as a block, much more so than Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionist or secular Jews. Usually, the more religious are secularized by education, access to Internet and participation in wider society but the Haredim's cult-like features largely insulate its members from becoming more reasonable. This seems like a recipe for major problems over the next decades for the State of Israel and its citizens. It also bodes ill for the world peace since Israel has a powerful military\* and nuclear weapons. 

&#x200B;

Am I basically getting this right? How do you think this will evolve over the next decades?  How will this affect Israel's non-kooky citizens? What geopolitical implications could it have?

I have, for obvious reasons, tried to leave out identifying details. Thank you to everyone who gave me the nudge to tell this story.

TLDR: The ‘pro-Palestine' movement lied to me and preyed upon personal vulnerabilities so I would act as a fig leaf for their antisemitism. I eventually discovered how callous they were with Jewish lives and the extent to which their real motivations did not align with anything that benefits the Palestinian people. I now believe that similarly uninformed ‘international input’ may be a driver in the conflict.

_Entering Activism._ I made the worst decision of my life when I took the advice of some people who told me that a degree from an American university was best, and enrolled in an American university as a college freshman. I had lived in America before, so I thought I would be able to handle myself and I felt rather ‘worldly’ at 18 — which really just meant that I didn’t know how to say, ‘I don't know.’ It seemed impossible to me, given my ethnic/national background, that I would know so little about the conflict… but at that time, I could barely distinguish the West Bank from Gaza. At first, I tried to steer clear of the topic, but this ended when I became extremely invested in a major ‘hot button issue’ in the US at that time — a particular pipeline running through historically Native American land. This is how I met a group of people who would change my life for the worse: a loose-knit collective of leftist activists who taught me the difference between leftism (the good one) and liberalism (very bad!) — between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation — between bisexual and pansexual (oh boy). Suddenly, I was a social justice warrior not from behind a keyboard, but in person — first we carpooled to protests, and then at some point, we were the ones organising the protests. 

_’How big of an activist were you really?’_ Not very big, lol! We were little fish in a big pond. My crowning achievement of the activist phase was when I met a big-name politician at one of my protests. I never appeared on tv or did interviews (although I eventually did manage to spark some far-right backlash and a tiny online doxxing effort). It ended there, thankfully. 

_’So how’d you get into this issue?’_ As I ‘unlearned my internalised prejudice’ and ‘activized,’ I kept getting drawn closer to the topic of I/P, which as I’ve mentioned, I had about an ankle-depth knowledge of. I remember one of the first big conversations we had about it, where they went on a vitriolic rant about all the ways Israel was bad, and then they stopped, and let the silence hang — this was my time to either cement my ‘membership’ or get kicked out. I uncomfortably said some version of ‘yeah, fuck Israel!’ They made it sound like an open and shut case, and what would I do about it? Just stand aside? No chance! I had to let Israel know that I _as a Jew_ didn’t want them to do these things! _As a Jew,_ I had to do something about the atrocities being committed ‘in my name!’ (I specifically remember using that phrase, which honestly makes me cringe to even type)

_My exact political positions._ I actually wouldn’t have been able to remember in great detail since there is a lot of water under the bridge, except that while doing some lazy googling I recently stumbled upon an old Quora thread asking ‘who is right, Israel or Palestine?’ And one of the top answers was an Israeli saying, ‘as an Israeli, I’m telling you that you should support Palestine, because they need your support more.’ And that brought back to me the entire old chain of logic. That’s how I thought. I sincerely believed that Israel was under no threat — but the Palestinians were. (Note the deceptive phrasing, which was common at the time: Israel was a monolith, whereas Palestinians were many individual human beings) I believed that it was our duty to impress upon the stronger actor the necessity of doing better in all respects, and support the Palestinians in their struggles as the downtrodden and disfavoured (_it’s not fair that one kind of person has better quality of life than another, just based on where they were born!_ thought I). I believed that Israel had the power to end the conflict and create lasting peace. I believed that the Palestinian demands were reasonable (yet somehow, we never spent any time actually discussing the deals which have been on the table) but at the same time I believed that the harm which had been done to them was probably too vast to ever fully be repaired. Perhaps most embarrassingly, I believed that if enough people said ‘No Israel! Stop doing the bad things!’ Israel would realise that there was a better way, and would stop doing the bad things, and then the world would be a better place.

_Why I started to doubt._ It was getting to the point where, having turned out for all kinds of actions on all kinds of other issues, at some point soon I was going to either have to go and hold up a Palestinian flag on a college campus, or make a huge life change — and I already had doubts brewing. I’d been avoiding a direct, physical presentation of this sentiment because I had eventually done some research, and things didn’t add up. There was so much that they left out of the narrative, so many inconsistencies, and maybe in the back of my mind there was even something assimilated from my background that made me think… this doesn’t feel right. 

_The breaking point._ But then there was a major shooting at a synagogue in the US and someone I know was personally affected. This was a crucial moment in my life. I truly believed that I would become the recipient of the support which we had been giving to every other marginalised, disaffected group when something bad happened to them — but the silence was deafening. I asked what we were doing about this and they said how awful it was but… nothing. No action was planned. No major show of solidarity with the Jewish community. Quietly, questions of — were the congregations Zionist? trickled around, just out of earshot (but one other person later confirmed my suspicions that the question was asked.) There was a sense of dissatisfaction, like the attack was an inconvenient distraction from ‘the main story’ — and I saw for the first time that I had fallen for a scam. Treat my time and energy like money — now think of the _’first they come for x, then they come for-‘_ thing — now imagine this was like me investing in the human rights pension fund. I keep putting money in for the collective defense of human rights, and eventually I’m the one whose rights need defending, and all the people I’ve stood up for will now stand up for me.

Right? Wrong. Not if you are Jewish.

_My current political positions._ I am staunchly pro-Israel. I believe in taking small, unsexy, bureaucratic steps to lessen the friction between the two parties so we can cohabitate in this area with less violence. Things like: they get rid of the martyr’s fund and we make some significant changes in our permit-issuing systems to speed along their economic development. I also strongly believe that the world needs to stop pandering to or even passively accepting any viewpoints which imply genocide: ‘from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free’ should earn jail time in Western countries. We must also have international funding reforms: the states who contribute to the PA/UNRWA/etc. must use their leverage to force anticorruption measures. Speaking of UNRWA, it must be abolished immediately and all Palestinian refugees must be resettled under the mandate of the UNHCR. We cannot continue to play to the fantasy that Israel will vanish: we must address the plight of the Palestinians in a sustainable way which inches towards stable, limited autonomy (without falling on our own sword in terms of security, and expecting the international community to stop the bleeding, as ‘antizionist jews’ do). But perhaps the most important thing I can contribute is to say that a viewpoint which would centre Palestinian lives requires separating the Palestinian political leadership’s goals from the wellbeing of the Palestinian people. Who is served by keeping them in the camps without resettlement? The political leaders, for whom they are a bargaining chip. Who is served by intifadas? The Palestinian leadership, for without the chaos which places Israel as the convenient scapegoat, their incompetent governance would be plain for the world to see and they could not continue to redirect domestic discontent. Why would the Palestinian leadership even want to improve the conditions of the people when the international aid rolls in only on the basis of well-publicised deplorable conditions? We are all falling for it: the propagandised Palestinian population, the international community which pays to keep the status quo grinding along painfully, and of course you, my pro-palestinian reader who believes that you’re going to create positive change in the world by commenting ‘free Palestine’ on any post featuring an Israeli or, dare I say it, sometimes just a Jew.

I am an imperfect messenger but my message is my truth, so I challenge you to skip any critiques of my writing style or word choice and address the substance of what I have said."

1. I wanna say tho that I am jewish and that I've faced a LOT of crap for it and even someone said to me that palestine should be free (this happened back in high school a couple years ago) which confused me. Which is how I learned about the war. But now looking back at it, idk why being jewish led to anything about me being a reason for the war. In all honesty, I'm all for jews having their own place to stay especially since Israel has a lot of jewish history in it, but I'm not keen for how they commit plenty of war crimes. But it seems strange how so many people I see online will rip on jews and and Israel even tho what they're doing is like what people have done forever. I mean, america was made just by people coming over her and killing native americans and people are fine with that. So it feels kinda hypocritical to me.
2. I saw a video of a guy who was Israeli and said that the war isn't what we actually think it's like and that palestinians and jews aren't actually hateful of each other and it's more towards the government and stuff and that people shouldn't take what the media and news says. Idk if what he says is 100% true so that's why I also came here too to ask. But it also bothered me how everyone in the comments just gave him crap. It was the same when I saw a video of a group of jewish people meeting the person who saved them during the holocaust years later and people in the comments were saying ""free palestine"" when it had nothing to do with it.

Sorry if what I say sounds stupid. I'm 19 and haven't been online a lot to see all the news and everything about it so I wanted to come here and ask to learn more. I'm just aggravated with how someone being jewish means your part of the problem and stuff."

1,2023-09-12,My complete guide to learning Hebrew fast,u/forrey,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/16glnv7/my_complete_guide_to_learning_hebrew_fast/,"I wrote this as a comment in the /r/Hebrew subreddit but thought it might interest people here.

I went from knowing only Hebrew letters to mostly fluent in about 2 years, then full fluency in about 3 years.

To get to fluency in a language, I believe you have to treat it like a bodybuilding program. An effective bodybuilding program will work every major muscle group of the body in dedicated sessions, and probably mix in some cardio and cross/functional training as well. If we take that principle and apply it to language learning, it can be very effective.

Start by building a base of different types of exercises. The main ones I used were:

* Duolingo - nice for building basic vocabulary and getting exposed to basic grammer
* Memrise - has an accompanying set for drilling the words you learn in Duolingo
* Flashcards - I used the brainscape app. Every time I ran into a new word, I added it, in packs organized by subject (like ""professional hebrew,"" ""politics,"" ""nature & hiking"" etc).
* Verb drills - take verbs you learn in other places, and start writing down all of their conjugations. Start with present tense, then add past, then future. Say them out loud as you write them down, and check your work after on [pealim.com](https://pealim.com). You can also get the book [501 Hebrew verbs](https://www.amazon.com/501-Hebrew-Verbs-Verb/dp/1438010400).
* Youtube/netflix - watch free Hebrew language programs \*with Hebrew subtitles.\* Stop on every sentence. Read the subtitles, look up the words you don't know, add them to your flashcards, say the sentence out loud to work on pronunciation, then keep watching. Particularly good shows are היהודים באים (Youtube), When Heroes fly (Netflix), Ramzor ([here](https://www.mako.co.il/mako-vod-keshet/ramzor)).
* Conscious observation - if you're in Israel, consciously absorb your surroundings. Look at street signs, translate them, write down new words. Listen to the announcement on the bus. Eavesdrop on conversations. Translate menus.
* Radio - download a free radio app and listen to 10-15 minutes. Try to pick out words as you go, look them up, write them down, repeat back sentences. This is a great drill for listening comprehension.
* Podcasts - same as above, but you can repeat sentences until you get them down and then repeat them back.
* Newspaper articles - read 2 paragraphs a day (to start) from [ynet](https://www.ynet.co.il/home/0,7340,L-8,00.html). Look up every word you don't know, add them to flashcards. Great for building vocabulary of current topics.
* Books - start with kids books like diary of a wimpy kid. Look up every word you don't know. Try to read out loud as much as possible.
* Writing - start a journal. Write down just stuff about your day in the journal in Hebrew, looking up words as you go. If you know a native speaker who can check it over, all the better. If not, don't worry, you'll start to recognize mistakes the more you learn.
* Conversation - crucial, and the most difficult here. If you live in Israel, force yourself to speak Hebrew out in public (stores, etc). Accept that you won't understand many of the replies. Ask people to repeat themselves slowly, tell them you're learning Hebrew. After interactions, add new words to flashcards. If you're not in Israel, get a conversation partner, either locally or online. Even someone with whom you can trade a few Whatsapp voice messages.

\---

Great, now you have a base of exercises you can use. Now it's time to build a program. Tailor this to your schedule. The important thing is you do at least something every day. When I started learning I had a 45 minute bus ride to and from work every day, so I built the program around that. It looked something like this:

&#x200B;

||Sun|Mon|Tue|Wed...|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|AM|15m flashcards  /  15m verb drills  /  15m Newspaper|15m flashcards  /  15 Radio  /  15m Newspaper|15m flashcards  /  15m Verb drills  /  15m Youtube|etc|
|PM|15m writing  /  15m Duolingo  /  15m Memrise|15m Youtube  /  15m writing  /  15m Verb Drills|15m  Podcast  /  15m book  /  15m Writing|etc|

Keep at it. Be motivated. Make yourself stick to the program.

\---

Here are some extra bonus tips for the journey:

* Focus on Verbs. Most people focus on nouns, but this is a mistake imo. I firmly believe that the key to good Hebrew is building a strong base of Verbs. Verbs are the most versatile expression of Hebrew roots, the letter combinations on which all other words are built. For example, if I learn the Verb לגדול, which means ""to grow,"" (i.e. ""the plant is growing quickly"", הצמח גדל מהר), and I understand the different verb forms, I can now easily understand and recognize many related words like להגדיל (to increase, i.e. I am increasing my hours at work), לגדל (to grow, i.e. I am growing a plant). It also makes it easier to recognize the root in various nouns, like גודל (size), גידול (tumor), גדילה (growth), מגדל (tower, related because it grows from the rest of the building), אגודל (thumb, the largest finger on the hand), etc etc. So in all exercise, give special attention to Verbs.
* Be prepared to plateau. Just like in bodybuilding, you will get to a point where your progress will stop. This is ok, it's natural. When this happens, take a break, shake things up. Stop your program for a few days, or watch Hebrew Netflix with English subtitles, or read just for fun without looking up lots of words and writing them down. When you come back, shake up your program, try new things, watch new shows, etc.
* Be prepared to be uncomfortable, especially when speaking. Accept that you'll be uncomfortable, that you won't understand things, that interactions won't flow as smoothly as they do in your native language. You'll fee stupid sometimes. Accept the feeling, and remember that it's part of the journey to fluency.
* If you live outside of Israel, this will all be much more difficult, simply because you won't be surrounded by the language every day. It's not impossible, but be prepared to talk to yourself a lot so you get practice speaking out loud."

No other country in the world is the product of a people who have been forced out of their homeland for several thousand years only to return to their indigenous homeland, which unfortunately is not rich in resources or anything of the sort, and turn it into a start-up nation, one of the world's greatest tech hubs, all this despite numerous efforts by many neighbors to try and destroy Israel all at once. Each time they have failed, and despite me not being Israeli (but Jewish) Im just so incredibly proud we even managed to establish a country in our homeland despite the many attempts at challenging us and exterminating us, where we have Jerusalem as our capital once again, that is home to some of the most beautiful, smart and loving people in the world, where we have autonomy over ourselves, a jewish state, a jewish flag, and overrall just a bustling hub of jews from all around the world, who came here before the state was created or afterwards when it was in terrible shape to build it and help it propser and to defend it with their lives without question. It's a beacon of hope and democracy and progress in the middle east and our only safehaven. You might not realize how great your country is when you're on public transportation going to work every morning in Israel, but please take a little time out of your day to appreciate the miracle of Israel. i think it could help foster a new sense of pride and protectiveness over it that everybody should feel for their country.  


Sorry, I know this is all quite corny but im not sure if all Israelis internalize just how great our (our as in Jewish) country is. Sure, our country has some issues, but the fact that we even have a country that can have issues with it in the first place is a miracle on it's own.

Could anyone recommend additional online platforms, books, or apps that are suitable for beginners? Any tips to make the process more effective would also be greatly appreciated.

My apologies in advance if this has been asked numerous times on the sub, however I did not find any relevant information regarding my case, as such there is no precedence. 

I am a hungarian national, and I know, according to orthodox jewish traditions one is only a jew if she is born to a jewish mother. 

My grandfather from my father's side was ethnically and religiously a jewish born person. He then later converted to christianity in order to somewhat escape persecution, sadly he was taken do a concentration camp anyway, but luckily escaped (I do not know if a later converted jew plays a role here) Then he married an ethnically christian non-jewish woman and after that my father was born. My father was baptised as a christian, thus he has no ideological nor ethical roots to judaism.

So technically I am an ashkenazi jew (somewhat). I have also been baptised as a baby.

Regarding my jewish ancestry I could definitely prove that I am jewish.

Is there any legal window for me to be considered a jew?

Cute shirt. An Egyptian girl on campus literally snarled and asked me why I’m wearing an Israel shirt. She started mocking me and asking me what I’m trying to say. I told her it was an unproductive argument I wasn’t willing to engage in. I continually insisted I was not interested. She stood there looking like an idiot and started following me before finally walking away and saying, “Okay, Palestine shirt.” 

I’m an Ethiopian Jew and I’ve had this experience quite a few times with American arab immigrants. With no intention of approaching the situation diplomatically, they become nasty and angry. An old friend of mine told me I had blood on my hands after finding out I was going to Israel for vacation. Well what about your mother who’s tax dollars fund Israeli settlements. Is that how you change someone’s mind? It’s this exact behavior that keeps Israel strong. If you really believe in a free Palestine, you are by all means entitled to your own way of thought, but what are you actually doing to secure the future of a free Palestine if that’s what you want? 

I have no interest in entertaining this idea of a corrupt Israel, the whole world is corrupt, the United States even more corrupt than Israel. That’s why Americans getting aggressive about Israel is laughable to me. I don’t say this as a justification for the brutalization of Palestinians. But as a Jew, I’m willing to compromise my morals for the sake of Israel. I have spent a considerable amount of time there and I truly feel at home there. Unfortunately I have not had much interactions with those who identify with Palestine... I have no problem admitting that. If a solution exists for both Jews and Palestinians I would support that too, but I don’t see it in sight."

He has two older siblings, one who is 48 and the other one who is 45. His sister is 45. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 months and we are dating to get married. I was straight about it to him and same with him to me. We are a match made in heaven, he is perfect. But his family is something else. His family is really not supportive of him, don’t really care about his life, and don’t ask much things about him. They will also ask him if they can borrow money from him. They barely know me although his mom has seen me plenty of time. However, his sister….OMG, I don’t even know what to start with. She asks her mom to clean her kitchen and the house because she is too tired, asks her to come over to kill the fruit bugs, complain all the time, tells her 6yo to shut up, and there are a lot more. To me, she’s a total looser. 

Last week, my boyfriend’s mom went for a walk with the dog, and decided to leave the dog at her daughter’s place so her son could play with the dog. She did not ask my boyfriend for his permission. This was, for my boyfriend, the cherry on top of the sunday and his sister and him went on a massive verbal fight where she ended up insulting me. Now usually, I’ll be wtvr if someone insults me, but she touched a nerve that can make me go freaking nuts and idk what I’ll do next time I see her. 

For personal context, I converted to Judaism and officially became Jewish May 10th 2022 after 3 years of learning with my rabbi, being in the community. I keep kosher, observe Shabbat, the mitzvot are crucial and will have a Jewish home and raise my kids Jewish. 
However, she told him, while thinking I couldn’t hear “ Go finish convert your goya “ and that I was fat. I’m not even fat, I have curves, but
No where near fat. Even if I was, that’s
Not her problem. 
I was called retarded by her son and fat and she told me “ Oh he just doesn’t know what he is saying”, and never apologized. 

I worked really hard to become Jewish, 3 years of changing my entire lifestyle and I don’t regret it a second. But I hate being called a goya when I’m not. I dealt with Jewish imposter syndrome for 2 years, during my conversion and it ended a bit after I completed my conversion. It required lots of work to change that perception that you’rennot really Jewish. And tbh, my boyfriend’s family didn’t make me feel super welcome either, they never asked questions about me either…but that is what it is. 

Now, my boyfriend, if he tells his mom what his sister said, she just tells him to stop and will always side with her daughter no matter how mean her daughter can be to her. 

I’m just glad that my boyfriend is nowhere like his sister or even his family. 

Has it happened to anyone else to face such comments or a mean family from your boyfriend/spouce, etc? If so, how did you deal with it? 

PS: sorry for the typos, English isn’t my first language."

Israel is holding talks with Palestinians as part of efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia, the country’s national security adviser said Monday.

“I have been conducting a dialogue with them [Palestinian authorities] in the name of the prime minister for eight months,” Tzachi Hanegbi said in statements cited by The Times of Israel newspaper.

“The conversations are taking place as part of the five-way dialogue with Jordan, Egypt, and the US,” Hanegbi added at a conference at Reichman University in Herzliya.

“We are trying to reach agreements on security matters, so they will take responsibility for the matters that touch on their lives, Area A, and so that the IDF (army) won’t have to enter refugee camps in Jenin and Nablus instead of them,” he said.

Regarding the chances of reaching a deal to normalize Israeli-Saudi ties, Hanegbi said that an agreement is “likely to take place.”

There was no comment from the Palestinian or Saudi authorities on the Israeli statements.

Last month, Hanegbi cited “significant progress” in talks with Saudi Arabia and the US on reaching a normalization deal between Tel Aviv and Riyadh.

Israeli officials have talked in several occasions about an imminent normalization deal with Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia does not have diplomatic relations with Israel and opposes normalization with Tel Aviv until it ends the decades-long Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.

Six Arab countries have diplomatic ties with Israel, starting with Egypt in 1979, Jordan in 1994, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain in September 2020, and then Sudan and Morocco later that year.

I came across an anecdote by a guy over on another subreddit: back when he was in high school, his class visited the Auschwitz museum. His teacher and some of his classmates were viciously holocaust denialists, who decided to ""speak their mind about the deception"" to some of the museum staff (the anecdote specifically mentions the leadership of the museum). He doesn't know what exactly happened in the 15-20 minutes while ""the delegation"" was away on their idiotic quest, but when they came back, they were remarkably silent, and never brought up the topic of holocaust denial ever again.

This left me with two questions: How does the museum handle people who are openly holocaust deniers on the premises, and, if the anecdote is true, what on Earth could have been said in those 15 minutes that had this impact? 

Part of the reason why I'm asking is just curiosity. The other reason is that if the people of the museum managed to make an old, hungarian history teacher, one of the most antisemitic demographics, shut the hell up with their stupid bullshit in just 15 minutes... Whatever was said, I'd love to know! With all the far right thinly veiled fascist bullshit that goes on in my country, maybe I could try and raise voice against it, as feeble and small verbal attempts might end up being sadly."

1,2023-09-12,Dating someone who isn't Jewish and we are wanting marriage. What now?,u/TheAmazingBaldi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16gxbcl/dating_someone_who_isnt_jewish_and_we_are_wanting/,"This sub probably gets a lot of posts like these on the daily and I'm another person who needs some guidance and opinions from fellow Jews. 

Small background: I'm 23 and female. I grew up catholic until I was about 11 to 12 years of age, my family wasn't very observant and we went to church once in a blue moon. We didn't follow along with the community but we were your typical fsmily hanging Virgin mary portraits and lighting candles to saints around the home.

A year or two later, when I was 13-14 yrs old, my family and I found Hebrew Roots and started to follow that. We slowly shifted towards Messianic beliefs and started to follow what we believed was the real messiah, and followed bits and pieces of torah observance though we weren't Orthodox Jews. 

I went through a lot of ups and downs and discoveries in my messianic journey and I can say looking back there was nothing worth keeping or looking on fondly. 

After studying and getting Judaism's side of things with help from others in the community, I became a Baal Teshuvah and left Christianity all together. Though I feel much like a phony because I'm not very good at observance and also I'm technically not doing right because of my relationship with someone who isn't Jewish.

Side note: My family didn't know we were Jewish truly until around 17 years of age. For clarification, My family knows we sre based off traditions my great grandmother still had from her mother's grandmother. She taught them to my mother and my aunt did a family tree and found we are Jewish through my great grandmother. However, that is unavailable to us now because it's been lost and most people in our family with that knowledge are now deceased. My mom was only able to remember some of these things after we became messianic because she began to recall them. I am not stating that ""Messianic Judaism"" makes a person a Jew. Nor am I still messianic and I have not gone before a beis din to confirm.

Despite the religious turmoil and experiences, I've always been opinionated and strong-willed in my beliefs, nobody could move me into another direction unless I willingly studied and saught after things myself. It's probably a bad trait of mine to be so hard-headed but that's how I am.

Even while being messianic, I was certain I wouldn't change my religion for snyone or any cause. I believed it was the ultimate truth just like I do now with Judaism.

But I met my partner now when I was 17, still messianic, still believing in the trinity and having weird fringe beliefs.  I knew we weren't supposed to be together or wouldn't last in the long run because of my beliefs but I didn't want to let him go. I fell in love with this muslim man of mine. I didn't want to but I knew in the back of my head if I was going to raise my children Jewish I had to move on. There wasn't a way I would compromise, it's been seven years of arguing over this.

Weve spoken over it for years about religious differences and compromising. He would like to raise them only muslim, he said he before there would be no sending them to synagogue or any of that sort and whatever Judaism they would learn would be from his own examples.

I don't like this idea because I don't want them to miss out or lose who they are whenmy family lost it at some point and I'm technically carrying that torch. I also don't believe in Islam at all, Ive done enough studying with Judaism and Christianity to know that while theres similarities as my partner says, to me there is also irreconcilable differences in comparison to Islam.

And even if we both decided to compromise, and maybe taught them both religions and observed both religion's customs, I'm scared that it will just push any children we have away.

But I just want to be happ ly with my partner, after coming this far I feel so guilty because I knew better and failed my own people, but I'm also failing the man I love for even putting him in this predicament.

He's not asking me to convert but I'm thinking that someday I'll have children is what worries me.

He wants me to see similarities that bring us together instead of apart but it's hard for me.

 My partner has encouraged me towards monotheism, self-improvement, and has been there for me throughout my life, if that's not allowed in the community then I feel I don't want to be right anymore.


I'm torn between Judaism and my partner but in my heart I would choose my partner. It's been seven years and we want to be married and put this all to rest. What am I supposed to do or where do I go ? I messaged a local rabbi and had no response, chabad answered and I told them a bit of this story and the response said converts can not marry non-Jews. The response wasn't very helpful since that's what I know and I'm myself not a convert to begin with.

I just want honesty."

Reading slowly through the parasha of Noach in the Zohar I felt sorry humanity and then I accepted the human condition. I have no honesty idea why we have the powers to create heaven and hell on earth but that kind of power is overwhelming and it might explain human history. I cannot hold to my previous misanthropic views after the Enlightenment via the Zohar. What people are going through is something only Hashem can know 100%. Only He is capable of correctly judging someone. We shouldn't be judging each other so harshly. So much trouble in the world and we are all we've got. Humanity only has Humanity.

When I told my wife about the post, she laughed.  Then she posited the idea of joining the local Reform temple after reading everyone's replies.  Her thinking was that we'd both talked about our daughter missing out on the community built into church memberships.  I'd even brought up going to a UU meeting before just for the kind of fellowship involved--this was a few years ago.  

We know the rabbi at the local Reform temple fairly well, so I think we'd be fairly well received.  For that matter a member of the temple's membership board had been after me to come to services for several years after he learned the circumstances of my wife.  The thing is I'm firmly an agnostic so it's not like I could convert.  And my wife still insists she's agnostic, so we'd not be going with intent to instill religious fervor into our child.  It feels like it would be some performative cosplay type of taking advantage thing.  I understand the idea of my wife and daughter being Jewish by law, but it still feels a bit like cultural appropriation.  

On top of that, what would be my place?  Are there usually non-Jews in services?  Am I just there to turn the lights on and off?  I feel like if we were to do something like this, raising our daughter in the community, it would forever be plainly obvious to her that she has a place in her community and her father who's not part of her community.  That bothers me a little.  Does anyone have any thoughts?"

It's also midnight so I doubt many will read this. I know I know, good riddance to me. 

My reasons for unsubscribing is posts from this sub appear regularly on my home feed when I sign onto reddit and it's almost never positive posts from here. It's usually something depressing or stupid (or someone stupid being pandered to). 

I wish there was more celebrating of Judaism on here. There's so much awesome about Judaism and Israel. It rarely gets celebrated. 

I also wish there was more honesty about Judaism on here. 

There is room for Hillel and Shammai. That I have to speak in codes, is a reality of social media and reddit. But sad. 

This is not anyone's fault. It's not easy be a Jew in the world. It's not easy being a Jew on reddit. 

Indeed this is a subreddit of Jews and a Jew among subreddits. 

Thanks to the most mods for doing their best and policing a very difficult subreddit. 

Happy New Year Fam. Wishing you a happy and sweet new year.

Tl;DR I am unsubscribing as the upvoted posts are usually sad news or someone stupid being pandered to. I hope to see more happy news in my feed. Shana Tova.

Adam and Eve - not Jewish, first humans but not first Jews. Abraham - many insist he is the first Jew, but he is titled ""Abraham the Hebrew"" and not ""Abraham the Jew"", as the term ""Yehudi"" (Jewish) didn't exist yet during his time. The term ""Judaism"" only became a thing after the sons of Jacob got their land and the subsequent wars (based on Jacobs son Yehuda). 

I remember one of my teachers once said that the first person named as ""Jew"" in Jewish history is Mordecai the Jew (מרדכי היהודי), but i am curious to know if anyone has any more insight on this (relevant?) piece of history. 

So who is the first person titled as being Jewish? What are your opinions, disagreements, enlightenments, on this question?"

With people I met, the ethnic group that drawed my attention the most, were the US nationals.

Most of them that I met in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem (including Canadians) were extremely proud to be there. They told me they either moved in their 20s to serve in the IDF, or in their mid to late 30s with their families, including small children. 

I can understand someone who moves to another country for financial reasons, wanting to live in a more stable environment, or if their lives are in danger. Met plenty of those from Russia, Ethiopia and Argentina, and understand them completely.

But, this concept, to move from a huge, wealthy country, where you can make more than 100K$/year, all the way to the Middle East, to lower your standards of living and put your life at risk (especially those who choose to go live in Judea and Samaria, yikes!), is completely alien to me.

I (kinda) understand those from an Ultra-Orthodox background, wearing black or knitted kippa. For them, religion is a way of life, and willing to make sacrifices in order to live in a Jewish-majority environment.

But those that aren't, and don't have family in Israel...why? Why move here? Why not for example move to another US state, like so many recently moved from California to Texas?

I apologize if I come across as brash (yep, Israel definitely rubbed off on me!), but I just don't find meaning in taking this kind of step towards a place that is not better from where you live, to leave stability for a war zone.

Don't get me wrong, I had a great time there and learned a lot, but I wouldn't live here permanently, it just wasn't for me. 

Where I come from, and especially those of my age, if someone wants to move to another country, they choose one that's wealthier, with a more stable political environment, with better infrastructure and financial opportunities, and with less corruption. That's why the mentality of the people I met in Israel was so foreign to me."

While the event is billed as ""a celebration of Palestinian art and literature"", it is likely to be anything but. 

One of the ""activists"" invited is Islamic University of Gaza professor Refaat Alareer, [who tweeted in 2018,](https://twitter.com/GileadIni/status/1470857056097902599) “Are most Jews evil? Of course they are.”

Another is Palestian researcher Salman Abu Sitta, who stated once that ""Jews were hated in Europe because they played a role in the destruction of the economy in some of the countries, so they would hate them."" He also has referred to Jews as [“ghetto-dwellers in Europe who came to take our land”](https://www.thejc.com/news/news/'antisemitic'-academic-to-give-balfour-lecture-to-mark-the-100-years-of-british-mandate-OC0mNSfQ4todvUFWBUTWn) and stated that ""only Jews are immune from … criticism"".

The executive director of the event, Susan Abulhawa, [stated that](https://aijac.org.au/op-ed/writers-festival-must-not-embrace-anti-semitic-hate/) after seven Jews were murdered in a shooting in Jerusalem, ""These people are vile. Armed human garbage. But I take comfort in knowing without a doubt that this colonial apartheid state will eventually be … wiped off the map.” She went on to say “Every Israeli, whether in a synagogue, a checkpoint, settlement, or shopping mall is a coloniser who came from foreign lands and kicked out the native inhabitants. They all serve in their racist colonial military. The whole country is one big, militarised tumour.”

The last ""activist"" of note is Roger Waters, who is not Palestinian so his ""art"" if you can call it that can hardly be described as Palestinian, but his politics are correct, so he's invited. 

Once again, the evidence is clear, the Palestinian cause and anti-Semitism are hopelessly intertwined. The director of this event is a bigot towards Israelis and she clearly has no problem with inviting people with a history of anti-Semitic statements to her event. Coming off Abbas' latest anti-Semitic comments that went viral, anyone who wants to separate the Palestinian cause from anti-Semitism is having their work cut out for them. Far easier to just admit the truth: 

The Palestinian cause is anti-Semitic from top to bottom."

(Reform),u/Bulky_Ad3957,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/16hs28x/would_it_be_appropriate_for_me_to_wear_tichel_at/,"I've been attending shul for a little shy of a year but after moving across the country I am just now about to begin my work with a Rabbi and taking the URJ'S Introduction to Judaism class to convert (at my Rabbi's request) and I have been doing a lot of thinking on modesty. 

I lived pretty immodestly for a long time. It's something I've grown from and I've really embraced modesty. 

Previously at my old shul a mix of everyone wore kippot and I had two friends (one an unmarried woman and one a married non binary person) who wore Tichel both in and out of shul. Though they'd take it off for things like work or hanging out with friends outside of a religious setting. So my understanding is that this isn't very typical in a Reform community. 

I love that a kippah is a symbol of acknowledgement that G-d is always above us. My desire to wear Tichel comes from that as well as a desire to live more modestly. 

I guess my question really is, would this be appropriate so early on in my conversion journey? 

I feel like I'm coming to this from a place of respect and understanding and appreciation for the religion and culture but I understand that I am capable of crossing boundaries."

You must obey your superiors no matter what and you could get in a lot of trouble if you don't. Basic training is designed as an *severely* stress-inducing environment on purpose to prepare you for combat. 

I've heard that the IDF still has emphasis on hierarchy and order, but it is more focused on getting the mission done effectively, kind of an ""ends justify the means"" thing where if you disobey an order but end up saving your fellow soldier's lives then you won't get in trouble. The culture is less about breaking recruits down and building them back up again, and more of a ""this is what needs to get done no matter what"" thing. I have seen videos on YouTube where in the US Military, drill sergeants will get into recruits' faces and scream at them as loud as they possibly can but in videos I've seen from the IDF it seems a bit calmer. Can anyone who has served in either military or both tell me the difference between the two?"

1,2023-09-13,Moving to Israel from Russia,u/c_jen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/16hvga1/moving_to_israel_from_russia/,"Greetings!

I'm around 40 yo, male, single, no family, no children. I was born and live my entire life in Russia. My ancestors are ashkenasi jews, mostly from Ukraine who were evacuated by the soviet authorities deeply inside the Russian territories during the WW II.

It appears that my homeland country becomes involved into a serious war conflict that I don't want to be a part of. By many reasons, but not the last one is that I don't want to find myself targeting weapons to my friends and relatives from the other side of the front line. By this reasons I decided to escape my country of birth, and today I live in various post-soviet countries as a nomad without a clear idea about my future.

I think as a jewish I'm eligible for the Law of Return. I don't know much about Israel. I have a lot of jewish relatives and friends around the world, but no one in Israel who I can ask about this country. I will be appreciated if the Reddit community will shed more light for me about how the ordinary life looks like there. And how difficult would it be to start building a new life in Israel.

The good thing that I know of about Israel is that it is a quasi-religious jewish country, and I will not have that many issues in sorting of kosher/non-kosher food (as I had to do in Russia), and following of the jewish calendar. The bad thing that I heared about is that prices in Israel are high, and it is almost impossible to buy a flat in any reasonable prospective, also that the country is highly regulated in many aspect of life.

The last thing (about regulations) is especially scares me. I'm an escapist and introvert person. In Russia I used to live a life as isolated from the society as possible. I don't have any records of education or work experience, or involvements in anything official. I never did anything illegal, but it seems to be that recently Russian authorities become more curious about people like me who, basically, don't fit. And it was another reason I decided to leave.

It is a little bit of a broad question, but how do you think how people like me would feel in Israel in this sense?

I apologize for my long post, and if it does not fit the community terms well. These are things I probably will not be able to ask in Sokhnut.

As you may or may not know the majority of Bulgarian jews are sephardi.
But, before the sephardis flooded the country after the expulsion in 1492 there were mostly 
Ashkenazi (and some romaniote) communities there. Even read on Wikipedia that when a traveler (from Italy I think) visited Sofia or maybe it was some other district of Bulgaria, he wrote documents of his travels and he specifically wrote that it wasn't uncommon hearing Yiddish in the streets.

Due to the amount of sephardic jews fleeing to Bulgaria the other Jewish communities just sort of ""merged"" together.

Edit: also after the 16th century till the 20th century some Ashkenazi jews used to migrate to Bulgaria because the ottomans who ruled the land at the time used to be kinder to jews.

I really wanted to know the origin of this surname, and all of the people that I saw on Google who had this name were (other than some Bulgarian jews) mostly litvaks (Lithuanian jews), polish jews, and Russian jews which are all Ashkenazi. Plus as far as I know the ""Melamed"" who was teaching the little kids Torah and these stuff were called that specifically in the Ashkenazi ""Cheyder"" and not in any other Jewish community which wasn't Ashkenazi. 

When My mother thought about it, she did remember that before her family moved to Sofia, they used to live in the northern part of Bulgaria pelretty close to the border with Romania and that if someone would migrate from eastern or Central Europe it would probably be from this part of Bulgaria where they used to live.

It's really interesting and It'd be nice if you could share your opinion/knowledge if you have any about this subject.

Thanks!"

They all serve in their racist colonial military. The whole country is one big, militarised tumour.”

The last ""activist"" of note is Roger Waters, who is not Palestinian so his ""art"" if you can call it that can hardly be described as Palestinian, but his politics are correct, so he's invited.

Once again, the evidence is clear, the Palestinian cause and anti-Semitism are hopelessly intertwined. The director of this event is a bigot towards Israelis and she clearly has no problem with inviting people with a history of anti-Semitic statements to her event.

I had put the tekhelet strings (still in the unopened bag) on the top of our bookshelf for safekeeping. I was planning to tie them tomorrow so I’d start the new year with them. (It's my first set of tekhelet.) My best forensic reconstruction is that our kitten used an armchair to climb to the top of our bookshelf, knocked down the tekhelet, gnawed open the bag, and started fighting the strings!

Several times throughout my religious education, we had Rabbi guest speakers and they grew crowds and really commanded your attention. Every Rabbi I've ever met has been incredibly wise and gave a unique perspective to what otherwise would have been a Catholic-centric view on religion.

I'm not questioning my faith but I want to learn more about it, and part of it I think needs to be from a Jewish perspective. Christianity is an offshoot of Judaism, after all, and the study of Judaism contemporaneous to biblical times I think has merit to better understanding my faith.

Can I join a Jewish seminary as a Catholic and learn from them/study under them? And I don't mean pretend to be Jewish to ""get in"", I want to be forthright about everything. Would this be allowed?

PS: I'm 18 and otherwise naive about this stuff. I don't know if it's a dumb question or has an obvious answer. I'm not ready to enter a post-secondary school and begin my career, I want to explore my faith for a time beforehand. I do have a feeling I want to go to school for history."

My dad's maternal grandma was a Jew who married a Catholic man. As far as I know, my grandma was raised Catholic also. My dad was sent to Catholic school and physically abused by nuns. He's basically agnostic now and, whenever him being Jewish is brought up, he gets uncomfortable. I imagine he dislikes religion, especially Christianity, because of his trauma. 

I'm considering talking to my dad about observing some Jewish traditions. For example, when I get tefillin (b'ezrat HaShem), I'd like to put them on him. I feel like he could benefit from learning more about his heritage and his ancestors' religion. Of course, I won't force him to do anything he doesn't want to.

I have prayed and cried, pouring out my heart, yet the silence is deafening. I have tried different segulot and traveled to gravesites of the tzadikim, then cried and begged, but still, no answer.

It’s something I’ve been wanted to do for a long time. However, I do not live in a particularly religious community, I did not grow up in one, and my husband, as well as my extended family, essentially do not pray except at synagogue (it’s Conservative btw). We do always say the Shabbat prayers, make challah, light candles, etc, and we sometimes go to synagogue on Shabbat, but we don’t observe the day other than that. We observe every Jewish holiday as best we can, and we send our kids to Hebrew school. On my own, i do tons of reading & some prayer. But that’s it. 
My husband is not about to become more practicing, and certainly our parents are not, and besides those in my synagogue (who aren’t particularly religious, anyway) my town is VERY Christian.
I was thinking I could begin to incorporate more Halacha into my life by reciting the Shacharit, Mincha, and Maariv each day, and perhaps give up Internet/phone/spending money on Shabbat (despite how deeply annoyed my in-laws and friends will be…).
Does anyone have any advice regarding this type of situation and how to best move forward with more adherence to Judaism in this only mildly religious community?

Jews always lived in Ottoman Empire hapilly and in peace. Despite the events in the 2010s, Turkey and Israel started to manage good relationships again. I feel like we are natural friends as two secularish nations in middle east.  Do Israeli people consider these facts? When I talk with people in Turkey, people mostly sees Israel as a friend nation.

For context: I'm Peruvian-German and I'm working on a short film with my co-writer from Zimbabwe. We were both unhappy with the films being made and their lack of any political content or references, so we wanted to focus our next project on the experiences of refugees and immigrants living in Berlin and their treatment. I'm aware of the banning of Nakba demonstrations and I've included this within the story of the short. I think a lot of the European ignorance towards Palestine and other atroceties stems from a refusal to engage with the people and their experiences so I'd like to get to know anybody living in Berlin or online who'd be willing to help strengthen our understanding of this issue to depict as faithfully as we can. Feel free to comment here or message me for anything. Thank you"

personal thesis: Canaanites were all Phoenician but not all Phoenician are Canaanites 

and there is an forth and back when I try to find a valid argument that make the difference clear.

and last when I had read the genesis g-d described the canaanites as pantheon worshipper. I had read a Schlächter edition of the Old Testament German version. There was also an advice to one of his sons not to go there because they are not worshipping him. Was that a correct translation?   
i mean the canaanites where probably the most intelligence tribe who  settled with there ikea style boat part and the invention of the alphabet tactic the entire Mediterranean Sea cost. Seems pretty normal and wise folks to me, with decent moral aspects of life."
1,2023-09-14,The Name in printed texts,u/hexrain1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16igy2d/the_name_in_printed_texts/," 

What determines whether a text prints or substitutes for the Shem  Havayah, and additionally, what determines whether the Shem Havayah is  printed with nikkudot? Is it determined solely by the publisher? Does it  vary according to denomination? Does it differ between different  minhagim? Is it determined by whether it is a siddur or chumash?   When  the Shem Havayah is printed and includes nikkudot, is there an  explanation for why it would appear with nikkudot slightly varying from  the nikkudot of Elokim, Ad-ni, or Tzevakot?

My  second question is the same, but pertaining to inclusion/exclusion of the  cantillation/trope. Again, does it vary by publisher, denomination, or  minhagim, or whether it is a siddur or chumash? Something else? Does the  catillation vary according to these factors at all? I've seen some  texts of Tehillim include cantillation, but in some instances there is  no cantillation provided. What explanation is there for this?

&#x200B;

Any help with this would be much appreciated."

ASALA activities included conducting assassinations and terror attacks against diplomats and civilians. During the 70s-80s, ASALA had a strong presence in Lebanon, where they cooperated, trained, and shared intelligence with the other Palestinian terrorists who were also present there at the time. ASALA fought against Israel during the war in Lebanon, while their base in Lebanon was destroyed during the war, their alliance with Palestinian and other international terrorist groups remained. 

To this day, ASALA and their activities are glorified in Armenia, having places named after them and monuments built in their honor.

1,2023-09-14,Palestine Can't (But Always Does) Reveal Its Racism,u/TracingBullets,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/16ii4ta/palestine_cant_but_always_does_reveal_its_racism/,"I was watching the Netflix documentary “Spy Ops” and they had a two parter about “Operation Wrath of God”, the Mossad operation depicted in Steven Spielberg’s film “Munich” which hunted down the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich Olympic massacre. To those unaware of that incident, Palestinian terrorists on orders from Yassar Arafat broke into the Olympic village in Munich, murdered several Israeli athletes, took several more hostage, and then eventually killed those hostages as well. It was a horrific massacre, made all the more horrific in light of the facts that it took place on German soil in the first Olympics in Germany since the infamous 1936 games while the entire world was watching. 

I was thinking about that incident when I read [the words of Khalil Al-Shaqaqi](https://www.wattan.net/ar/news/412936.html), the Palestinian head of the Palestinian Center for Political and Survey Research, an institution I like quite a bit and find very useful. He was explaining why he signed the letter condemning Abbas’ latest anti-Semitic tirade, [which I wrote about here.](https://reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/16fv24x/ali_abunimah_and_mohammed_elkurd_respond_to_the/)

> ""The Holocaust is a European issue and the Palestinian people are the ones paying the price for it. The president increases the problems of the Palestinian people, with baseless statements based on the words of some marginal historians. Therefore, we issued the statement because **we believe that what the president spoke is harmful to the Palestinian cause**."" 

> ""There is respect and support for us in the world, and **if the world feels and sees that the Palestinian people support what the president said, this will mean to them that the Palestinian people are racist,** and this means to them that there is racist settler colonialism, and also racist Palestinians, and therefore they will put us and Israelis are in the same dark trench. If we go into the same crucible of racism and anti-Semitism, we will become no different from the occupier.""

One quick note, Al-Shaqaqi is supposed to be a pollster who researches people’s opinions, so he’s admitting his bias here, but no real surprise there. It seems clear to me that every person who has signed the letter, including Al-Shaqaqi, doesn't condemn Abbas' remarks BECAUSE they believe anti-Semitism is inherently wrong or that Palestine is opposed to anti-Semitism (lol). They condemn the letter because it makes them and their nation look bad and makes it harder for them to get what they want. This is a consistent pattern you will see on the rare occasions that Palestinians and pro-Palestinians condemn someone on their own side: their motives are entirely self-serving.

But the main point is Al-Shaqaqi is one of the few Palestine supporters smart enough to realize the truth: The Palestinian “cause” (whatever that means) relies on being perceived as victims and the virtuous side, which explains why it has done pretty much nothing but fail over the past 75 years. If the Palestinian people were to be perceived as anti-Semitic ([which is exactly what most of them are, according to Pew in 2010](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2010/02/04/chapter-3-views-of-religious-groups/)), then they’re sunk. AT BEST they’re no better than the Israelis, the same Israelis they spend every day calling every nasty name in the book. The Palestinians are already losing support across the world due to in my opinion the rampant war crimes and the refusal to make peace for decades, if the nations of the world woke up and realized they’re anti-Semitic on top of that, the support they get from non-anti-Semitic sources could dry up completely. The Munich massacre discussed above is similar to Abbas' remarks, the Palestinians in the eyes of the world violated one of the few institutions that stand for peace and cooperation worldwide, damaging their own need to be perceived as victims. 

If this all seems obvious to you, as it does to me, then you’re clearly not a pro-Palestinian activist. Because pro-Palestinian groups continue to host events like [the one at Penn I wrote about](https://reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/16hmq0p/jew_hatred_hosted_at_university_of_pennsylvania/), with blatantly and obviously anti-Semitic speakers. And that doesn't even get into the harassment of Jews, the violence against Jews, the mockery/exploitation of Holocaust victims, and so on. You know what they say, you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can’t fool all the people all of the time. What's really amazing to me is why more people don't see Palestine and its activist squad as anti-Semitic. I suspect though that the nations of the world KNOW Palestine and its cause is anti-Semitic, for all the reasons we talked about [here,](https://reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/13vsrn4/cmv_propalestinians_should_be_assumed_to_be/] but are simply too politically correct to say it.

There's a lot of reasons that the Palestinian cause hasn't gotten anywhere in the past 20 years, but one of the main ones is that Palestine needs to be perceived as a virtuous victim, but it's not, so it can't make a convincing case that it is."

I’ve shared a bunch re my year and what was my upcoming wedding (happened Sunday. 24th of Elul. Which is a very important date ) and I thought I’d provide an update (and a blessing as I’m
Still riding the wedding high ) 

There have been some posts here and on /Judaism re racism in the community. I’ve been one who loudly says it needs to be discussed. My wife and I felt it first hand rather griffin quickly in our relationship. God willing I’ll be raising biracial children and I want the world, and our community, to at least be a little better than it is today.  Others deny it. Others accept it but feel like speaking about it on Jewish Reddit threads is problematic. This post isn’t to debate any of that. Another time. Another place. 

This post is to highlight the tremendous Kiddush Hashem that took place at the wedding. 

Just about every member of my wife’s party made it known to be how
Welcomed they felt (and how anxious they were leading up to it whether they’d feel welcome or not) About 50 of her family stayed to the very end and hummed along to benching. 

For those who haven’t been following, I’ve had a tough year. 

My dad passed December 1. I then met my now wife Jan 1. We got engaged June 1 in Israel. Then I was woken up mid morning June 15 in Jerusalem with the call- my mom has now passed too. 

Leading up to the wedding, I was a wrecking ball of emotion. Excited. Happy. Sad. Guilty that I felt happy. More sad. Melancholy. Happy again. Mad. Angry. 

People kept telling me “the Zohar teaches that if you invite your deceased parents, they come to the wedding with H in the highest of spiritual forms”

I said “cool”. Sounds nice. It’s cute. But is it true? Who knows. It didn’t really do
Much for me 

A few days post wedding- I can say it’s true. For the first time in close
To a year, I was able to tap in. I heard my parents talking to me under the chuppah as if they were right there. But here’s the kicker 

Cleaning out some China from their house, I find a becher I hadn’t seen before. Deep in the back. I take it out and engraved on it I see “A And J W” my parents initials. 

“Neat” I think, I’d love
To take this home. Then I look
Closer. “ 24th of Elul 5740”

Unbeknownst to me, I got
Married on the same day as them. 

My bracha to us ALL as we head into auspicious time. Last weeks (I think) Torah portion speaks about things being “ a blessing and a curse” I thought this year I was being cursed. 
But without the way certain things went down, with both parents, I’d have never seeked out the kind of woman I did. 
For the blessings that come our way that are clearly blessings- we should soak them in as much as possible. For what appears to be curses- we should
Keep fighting until we see the light of said curse. Even if it takes months or years, we should have at least a small feeling of clarity that this too is for the good. 

A happy, healthy, holy
Special
New year to us all. Amen."

The last month I've had a pull to explore Judaism and learn as much as I can about it.

I haven't ruled out that one day I might want to take the next step and get our kids involved, too.

There is a Chabad synagogue fairly close by to me and then another that is ""unaffiliated"" - I have never heard of the latter, before.

I think they would welcome any sect since it's in a less populated area and it's the only synagogue in town.

After learning that Chabad is Hasidic, it makes me nervous as a non-Jew making contact and wanting to learn more. I feel like I'd be laughed out and banned from returning again.

But I've also read that they are very welcoming - although that may just be to Jews and not welcoming to non-Jews.

On the other hand, would an ""unaffiliated"" synagogue be a better place to start?

Also, as a related side question - if I did become a Jew one day, would our kids ""automatically"" become Jewish (at least in the eyes of Conservative and Orthodox) or would they need to do their part, too?"

I look to the south and I see Egypt, a country experiencing the biggest inflation it likely has ever experienced, already low on water with its water being further threatened by Ethiopea's dam

I look to Europe and I see a society that is forced to choose between collapsing duento low birth rates or importing so many people from third world countries to a point that it completely losses it's identity, and likely to also inherit the problems of the countries they got people from

I look at south Korea north Korea I see war of ideology, Ukraine Russia war of independance, Afrika war on water and resources.

And than I look into Israel and I am dumbfounded, why are we doing this to ourselves?

We built economy that is bigger and stronger than it has any right to be, we solved our water issues with state of the art technologies that WE developed, we are a diverse society that doesn't birthrate problem and we aren't expected to shrink anytime soon, we solved our wars, we survived 3 attempts of bigger armies to completely exterminate us

And I look and see our 2 biggest problems right now, both are so depressingky easy to resolve, and both threaten to destroy everything we achieved so far

The judicial reform - literally a made up problem, the courts have remained the way they are for decades, and the public generally agrees that the courts need a reform - it would have been so easy to take it slow, and do this reform over a long period of time with wide support instead of the criminal way it is being done now, instead of something that could be mundane and non controversial, it became a thing that splits this country to 2 halves

The Haredi - the Haredi birthrate is something that any western country would kill for, they could be Israel's powerhouse for the future, if only we actually forced to study ליבה, instead we are raising a children that are destined to become parasites (disclaimer, this isn't true for all Haredi, far far from it, but it is true for too many)

That's the end of my rant, we need to topple this government, and replace pretty much all right wing Knesset members with new people who would actually represent right wing values (which in Israeli context are free market and strong stance on security)"

Also, is there a way to make a cheesy potato kugel, or is that sacrilege?

Long, probably unnecessary and definitely boring story: 

My family are secularly/culturally/ethnically Jewish. My parents are having my wife and me over for Shabbat and Rosh Hashanah tomorrow night (along with my grandfather, his Israeli friend, and my mother’s friend). My wife and I recently (in April) became vegetarians. My mom called to discuss the menu for the dinner. She said she and my father used to be vegetarian long ago but had gotten out of practice, so they are planning on serving chicken or fish as the main dish. She asked me to bring roasted brussels sprouts, and said they would also make a sweet noodle kugel with dates instead of raisins (I hate cooked raisins). She asked whether that menu was ok with me. I said yes. Oops.

When my wife got home from work, she expressed displeasure with our main dish (the kugel) being a sweet one. She hates dates and doesn’t like having sweet dishes for anything but dessert. So I called my mom back to ask if they could make a savory kugel instead, and she got offended and told us we can bring our own food if we don’t want what they’re serving. So I want to prove that a tasty, savory kugel is possible, but I’ve never made one. The recipes online are all similar with a few differences (some have matzo meal and some don’t), and they all sound kinda similar to latkes except they’re baked and in the shape of a casserole. Can I add cheese to make it more flavorful, or would that be un-Jewish of me? 

Please give me all of your savory potato kugel recipes and advice!"

On its website, Palestine Writes describes itself as “the only North American literature festival dedicated to celebrating and promoting cultural productions of Palestinian writers and artists.”

The festival will largely be conducted in person across multiple facilities on the UPenn campus.

Among the speakers to be featured at the Palestine Write Literature Festival are individuals who have made anti-Jewish statements or support terrorist organizations or activity against Israel and Jews.

Among these individuals is British musician Roger Waters, the former frontman of the rock band, Pink Floyd.

Waters has made comments such as suggesting that more artists don’t oppose Israel because “the Jewish lobby is extraordinarily powerful” in the US. The artist has also held concerts that have been condemned as antisemitic in the past. One 2013 Waters concert featured a large, inflatable pig with a Star of David on it. 

In another concert in 2023, Waters wore a uniform resembling that of a Nazi SS officer and compared Anne Frank to Shireen Abu Akleh. 

Another speaker to appear at the UPenn Palestine Writes festival is former CNN commentator, Marc Lamont Hill, who praised the terrorist who attempted to bomb the Zion Cinema in downtown Jerusalem in October 1967.

Additionally, Hill was fired from the news giant after calling for a “free Palestine from the river to the sea,” a slogan understood by many to call for the utter destruction of the State of Israel. Hill was recently hired by CUNY, a university slammed by a 2023 report as “the most systemically antisemitic university in the United States.”

Other speakers include Wisam Rafeedie who praised the 1972 Lod Airport Massacre in an article from June of this year, Salman Abusita who claimed in a video that Jews were hated in Europe because they played a role in the destruction the the economy in some countries,” Nadia Tannous, a member of the Palestinian Youth Movement, an organization that publicly supports terrorism against Israelis, and others.

I'm working on my doctorate. A few weeks ago, I turned in something that's one of the milestones on the way to completing my degree. I had some say in the deadline, and I scheduled it so it wouldn't conflict with the HHDs.

I got feedback about a week later saying I'd done it wrong and was given about a week extra to fix it. The original instructions were vague, and the clarification I got didn't really help, but I fixed it the best way I knew how and got it turned in.

Then I suddenly get a message saying something in it needs to be fixed and I have until tomorrow evening to fix it and re-re-submit it...

Like...the answer is no. Rosh HaShana starts tomorrow at sundown, and I usually take Fridays off anyway to prep for Shabbat. I don't have time for this. All of the other work I had already meticulously scheduled to be done by today had to be pushed back to the end of September because of the unexpected week-long side quest of re-submitting the first time. 

I appreciate the opportunities to show my work, but the constant, very random deadlines that assume there's no reason I should be able to ""get this to \[me\] by tomorrow"" with no issue is appalling. 

I'm already letting other people down because of constantly having to go back and ""fix"" these responses. The quality of my work is literally slipping in other areas.

Even if it weren't Rosh HaShana, what if I had a doctor's appointment tomorrow? Or a meeting? What if I had literally anything that took forever to plan for and can't be rescheduled? What if I were sick or otherwise in a state/situation where I couldn't work and complete something on such short notice?

This is literally the third time that I have rescheduled almost my entire life around this one assignment: classes and their assignments, research, manuscripts for my advisor, planning and prepping for the holidays. Literally just this morning, I scheduled it all out (to the hour) in a way that makes getting everything done possible (albeit not much wiggle room).

And then, between one blink and the next, I have like 12 hours—the final 12 hours before Rosh HaShana starts—to complete this project that I've already submitted twice over?

It isn't a time management issue, on my part. I really would admit it, if it were. But there just aren't enough hours in a day to do these things. I tried my best to schedule everything so they wouldn't overlap and interfere with one another. 

I'm just at the point where I'm, like....no. I won't get this back to you by tomorrow evening. I have other things I need to do. Namely, religious observance. "

2) Cedrat is a kind of sensitive fruit, do you have advises for transportation/conservation ? (I'm going to take a plane and two train and I'll buy it one week before kippour)

Where the hell are y'all meeting? Bars and clubs don't seem to work for me, and also don't really match the vibe I'm going for (LTR). And don't even get me started on the shit show that is online ""dating"".

1,2023-09-15,Jewish excellence,u/Snoo0Dall,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16j1wsm/jewish_excellence/,"I have been pondering the success of the Jewish people.

The Jewish community’s success is unprecedented. Off the charts. Unmatched.

No one has ever been this successful, and very likely no one will ever be as successful as the Jewish community has.

Yet, Jewish people tend not to talk very much about the Jewish community’s success. Record-breaking numbers of Nobel Prize winners. Record overrepresentation in the Ivy League. Astounding business success. Extreme academic overachievement.

Interestingly, I notice this with other minority groups, too. Black people don’t talk about their success in the NBA. Asians don’t talk about their success in STEM. And etc.

So I wonder: How do Jewish people perceive the Jewish community’s success? Does it feel expected? Does it feel routine?

How does it affect your self-concept? Do you expect success of yourself, because you see many Jewish people succeeding? Do you parent differently than a non-Jewish parent might, because you know it is possible for people of Jewish heritage to succeed in America?

How does it affect your conception of America and the West? Do you feel that America has been fair to minorities? If not, how do you reconcile those contradictory feelings?"

While I do understand Herzog’s intent here, I have profound distaste for the sentiment of “we should all listen to each other and come together.” It’s both-sidesism in its worst form.

One side wants to dismantle Israel’s judiciary and turn it into a religious dictatorship, and the other side does not. The side in opposition to this so-called “reform” includes the most educated segments of society and those who contribute to the economy the most. This include doctors, attorneys, civil servants, Mossad agents, Entebbe veterans. This side also includes both business leaders AND labor unions at the same time, groups which are supposed to be at each other’s throats.

Who is on the pro-“reform” side? Haredim, who are exempt from military service and have no stake in Israel’s protection. Itamar Ben-Gvir, who was literally not allowed to serve in the army because he was seen as too racist.

This is not a “both sides issue.” One side is destroying democracy and tanking the economy. Israel was running well enough until the right wing devised its authoritarian judicial coup.

Shana Tovah to everyone. In this new year, may all Israel live in peace and freedom."

The series is apparently on Hulu. I've always had pride in the fact that I never paid for a streaming service, but for this I was willing to decleare my defeat. I've tried to sign up for Hulu... only to discover it's not available in my country (Italy). A friend who is more tech-savvy than me tried to make sign up with a proxy, but that didn't work - Hulu doesn't accept my Italian card as payement.

I've tried looking at website of the HOT channels, which made the series, but apparently the website is unreachable.

In a spur of early-2000s nostalgia, I've even tried searching for a dvd, but it doesn't look like it got made (the only result is a very sketchy, very expensive and I'm 99% sure pirated copy on ebay).

I’ll try to keep this super short, but as the new year approaches and we are to seek forgiveness and atonement I’m really struggling this year more than most. 

Essentially, the one person who I have genuinely and admittedly been cruel to this year is my ex bf. We ended things absolutely horribly, speaking awful to each other and doing spiteful and vengeful things to each other for the few months following our breakup. We don’t speak at all anymore and we’ve hurt each other very badly. 

I am conflicted, extremely, on whether or not I should reach out and apologize for the horrible things I did to him. On one hand, this is what Rosh Hashanah is for, but on the other I don’t know if it would just make things worse to reestablish contact after so much hurt and vitriol has come between us. 

I’ve never felt this before and I’m not sure what I should do. This is probably the first and only person I feel I’ve actually sought out to cause pain and hurt to, and I’m not sure if even an apology would be well received or if it would be a bad idea. 

Have any of you been in a similar situation, what did you decide?"

At Passover she got very drunk and too close to starting a  physical “bar”-type fight with my 14 year old son. 

We have had many discussions over this as a family and set boundaries that in order to see her, no alcohol is allowed to be served, yet everytime I think of what she did, I’m so angry. My son laughingly called her out on her constant cursing by saying “language” and this led to her in his face calling him a p*say and saying his generation was a bunch of snowflakes. He tried to deflect as we grabbed up our things and left. 

I can understand why she did what she did, know her history and we’ve talked a lot about why she isn’t happy in her life and feels the need to turn to alcohol, so from that angle I can understand it. But as a parent I can’t forgive her- we had just put our second cat within 6 weeks down the day before, and literally only came down in the hopes family would boost our morale. My son had just lost his cat and now he’s got a family member yelling in his face? 

I don’t want to carry this anger with me into the new year, but I honestly don’t know what to do."

My second child is due October 1st. My first is a girl so we did not deal with a bris for her. These two kids are close together and not long after I had her we moved far away and near his family for a job he took. I've joined a synagogue here this summer and it's been very quiet while families vacationed and kids went to camp. So I really only know the Rabbi and a couple other people well. 

My in laws are Catholics. My entire family on both sides are Jewish but I live on the east coast and they live on the west coast. My father and brother are accountants (tax deadlines on October 15th) and with the due date where it is neither can travel to be present at the bris and hold the baby. My husband can't hold the baby because he isn't Jewish. Do I just default to the Rabbi? Ask a relative to fly here on very little notice for the 8th day? 

Also for celebrating I feel weird inviting my in laws and having majority non-Jews present for a Jewish ceremonial rite. But at the same time it feels strange to have no family there either. Any advice or ideas? Anyone care to share anecdotes? Thanks and Shana tova again!"

I know he feels no remorse. I know he’s a selfish jerk who couldn’t own up to what he did so he threw me under the bus instead. He will never apologize to me for the pain he’s caused me. 

I know I should forgive him and go into the new year with this burden off of my shoulders, but I can’t. Honestly, I hate him, I hate his guts. I hope he finds divine punishment and sees what a horrible person he is. But that’s antithetical to the spirit of Rosh Hashanah. 

What do I do? I don’t want to forgive him, and I don’t feel like forgiving him, but I know that it’s what’s expected of me. Any advice is appreciated."

Anyways, I was wondering if anyone knows of any residential ulpanim that aren't kibbutz ulpan programmes (just bc I'm already well-aware of them). I'm 20 years old (21 in Feb), not yet gone to uni and I'm hoping to make Aliyah around January if any of this is info that helps. I'm mainly looking for residential ulpanim as I know that they can be subsidised and I know someone who said when they done ulpan, they were able to get rents for like ₪800/month in Haifa although this was a few years ago.

She comes out of the kitchen with a round challah and proceeds to tell me in extreme detail the story of how she procured the challah and the line she had to wait in, then she comes over and gives it to me.

1,2023-09-15,"It's already one state, just not a democratic one",u/HopeOrDoom,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/16jsmgl/its_already_one_state_just_not_a_democratic_one/,"There is no such thing as a two state solution, at least anymore. There are so many reasons it cannot materialize, from rapid increase of settlers in the West Bank, to political divide between West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the fact that a third in West Bank and two thirds in Gaza Strip are descendants of refugees from cities like Haifa, Jaffa, etc... who will obviously reject this solution.

What's the current situation? Between the river and the sea, non-Jews are a majority, but Israel is in control of the entire area, with varying layers of control (full control of Tel Aviv, military control of West Bank, blockade of Gaza Strip). Israelis have relatively free movement compared to Palestinians.

Will an Israeli government ever risk removing the settlements from the West Bank to advance two states solution? Not in a million years, unless this government is keen on losing too many votes. Also, a big chunk of Israel is fueled by settler movement due to religious reasons, so if security wasn't a concern, settlements will keep increasing, and even will put in efforts to re-enter Gaza.

The only peaceful way forward is to dismantle the current system and replace it with a democratic one, meaning one that wouldn't favor people who happen to follow one (including parents') religion/ethnicity. There is no debate anymore about Palestinians being native to this land, and yet they're treated with discrimination. Even the Israeli citizens, that Israel always mention to claim democracy, include people who are internally displaced and are not allowed to reclaim their homes and/or recieve compensation.

A one state where Palestinians including West Bank and Gaza Strip are also citizens is inevitable. This is reality, but many people refuse to see it, be it on both sides.

What's the alternative?

Keep the status quo? Do you really want to see Israel-Gaza wars every while and continue with your lives like nothing is happening? Do you really want to see stabbings and continue your lives like nothing is happening? Do you really want to see Jewish settlers attacking Palestinian towns with no actions from the military? Do you really want to see Israel getting isolated slowly as voices calling it an apartheid state are growing louder (like the ex-chief said some time ago)? The status quo will at one point become too expensive to keep.

The final alternative is, which has been voiced by some Israelis AND knesset members, is... well... kicking out the remaining Palestinians (a Knesset member once said ""finish the job""), and ensuring a forever Jewish majority. Of course it's incredibly horrible, and I'm entirely sure there is no general support for this in Israeli society. However, for the people who DO consider this, if you're not worried about Israel's international image, are you sure Israel is able to do that?

Why is it important to seriously consider this and move towards a one democratic state? Because any other way could lead to chaos that could eat up the entire region. The current Israeli government is trying to take over everything, which is scaring investors away. This is nothing to what might come later. What if the current government becomes fully authoritarian? What if it becomes an Arab authoritarian state? What if it becomes a strict theocracy, Jewish or Islamic?"

But, despite the lack of anything concrete, the general public consensus has made the connection and effectively just states outright that ""Satan is the Serpent."" Is there any biblical reason to actually suspect this? Is there any real indication?

What did the ancient scholars think as a general consensus (there's always fringe groups)? What do modern scholars think as a general consensus?

1,2023-09-16,A few questions about studying religious texts.,u/snakeravencat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16jz5di/a_few_questions_about_studying_religious_texts/,"I'd like to preface this by saying that I'm not 100% sure about some of the terminology here, and so I apologize in advance for any offense I may cause, and hope my meaning is clear despite my ignorance.

Background: I've always been a student of religion, and have recently been looking at the origins and history of Judaism and related pre-semitic/proto-semitic belief systems, but I'm kind of tired of reading what other people have to say about some of these ancient texts, and would like to read them for myself. 

I've decided that I'd like to work backwards starting at the masoretic text as it was the basis for many of the popular English language Bible translations, as well as being rather faithfully reproduced from the original scrolls. (According to what I've read at least.)

Now to the questions:

Can anyone recommend a good digital version of the masoretic text? I searched the play store, but as an 'outsider', I don't know what is good or not. They could slip in some total nonsense, and I may not notice.

I did download Sefaria. Does anyone know if it's good? It claims to have many hebrew religious texts, in both hebrew and English, so it may be a valuable resource, but again, only if the information is accurate. They have 2 options for 'custom', either Ashkenazi or Sephardi. If I'm reading for research purposes, would this choice matter? What's the difference? I know these are branches (tribes?) of the hebrew/jewish people/faith, but I'm not sure what the distinction is.

As you can probably tell, there are some gaps in my knowledge of Judaism and it's adherents, so I'm not even totally sure if I'm starting in the right place. I just figured I'd work backwards from what I do know. (The bible) Would anyone recommend a different starting place? I know there are various religious texts within the jewish faith, but I'm not totally sure if I'm in the right place. Assuming I have chosen a valid starting place, what should I read next?

I will be simultaneously teaching myself hebrew, and am having no luck with the popular language learning apps because they don't start off basic enough, and are geared towards more modern communication besides. Can anyone recommend a good resource for learning the very basics of hebrew language? Like literally starting at alphabet (alephbeth?) and grammar structure and what sounds the characters make, but in English. I learn languages fast, but need those basics and hebrew is so drastically different from any other languages I've studied.

Tl;dr: 

Anyone know a good digital source for the masoretic text?

Is Sefaria any good?

What would you consider a good starting point for someone trying to read jewish religious texts?

Is there a good app or website to learn the basics of hebrew language?"

First time visiting Israel and it just happens that we arrive on the 23rd of September with Yom Kippur starting the following day. We are staying in Tel Aviv for 8 days. 

I understand that most things will come to a halt and therefore we already planned to spent the day by the beach (which is thankfully right next to the Hotel). 

My friend (from Tel Aviv but living in Germany) told me that restaurants may be open since there is a big Arab community (he’s Muslim himself) in Jaffa, Old Town. Is this still the case? (He moved to Germany 7 years ago and obviously things change).

Since it’s about 45 min along the promenade by foot, we were thinking about taking an E-Scooter like Bird or Lime that day. Are they operational and can we use them during the holiday or is it frowned upon? I don’t want to offend anyone with locals being like „those damn tourists“ or anything like that. 

Oh and as I understand, the holiday does not end until Midday on Monday right? So I guess it would be best to book day trips away from Tel Aviv from Tuesday on?

I assured them it was no problem, offered my condolences, and survived the rest of the service anyways. 

My question: is there anything in particular I could do to show my appreciation while also giving my condolences?

1,2023-09-16,The Wailing Wall is not likely a remnant of the Temple...,u/s_aint_me,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16k7u8n/the_wailing_wall_is_not_likely_a_remnant_of_the/,"David was king of the Israelites, and Judean. The land area for the decedents of Judah was the southernmost, so it was logical that David established his home and Israel’s capital city in Jerusalem, which is in the north of Judah. This conveniently places it in close proximity to the other 10 tribes, as near to the center of Israel as it could be and still be in Judah. (The weather is also better there, compared to southern Judah.)

Of course, the other major reason Jerusalem made perfect sense as Israel’s capitol is because of Gihon Spring. In David’s day this water source was much stronger, a full-scale underground river, which regularly rose to the surface at that place. It was, by far, the most important water source in that region. In fact, given Gihon Spring’s hydrological anomaly as a rhythmic spring, we can figure the water might have seemed miraculous, certainly blessed, to people of that era.

When the Levites began their operations in the city of David they would have needed substantial amounts of water every day, for the ritual sacrifices and purifications, so Gihon Spring was the perfect location. It is unlikely the Levitical priests would have schlepped all the necessary water, animals, tools, firewood, and themselves, up that rocky hill every day. Then there’s all the citizens and sojourners bringing offerings… In addition, the supposed Temple mount would have been a hygienic nightmare for both citizens and sacrificed animals. 

It should also be noted that Jewish Law required the priests to be perspiration free to perform certain duties, but it's impossible not to sweat on an uphill climb. And bodily waste needed to be buried on holy ground, which is difficult on a rocky mount.

Forward now to when Solomon builds the first temple out of the cedar trees (that David had stockpiled, gifted from his friend, King Hiram). It makes sense that Solomon would build that first temple where his father already had the Levites presenting the nation’s offerings to God. 

Now forward again, to the Israelites of the Babylonian era when the temple was re-built... The returning exiles were generally lacking in money and manpower to construct with giant stone blocks. They would have used wood again, as they could not have installed gigantic wooden poles in a rocky mountain top. But more important, wood re-construction makes sense, since Solomon, though fabulously wealthy as king during Israel’s zenith as a world crossroads, built that first temple with the same humble material.

In short, the Wailing Wall is actually the remnant of Roman fortifications (constructed about 500 years after the exiles returned and re-built the cedar temple). This first stone fort, built on the mount by the Romans, simply expanded its walls to surround the adjoining city of Jerusalem. 

To digress a moment, it needs to be noted that the distance between this wall remnant and Gihon Spring is small. So the fortifications could have been used to help protect the water supply from any invaders. But the stone wall itself was not part of the wooden temple.

Looking back again, can you really believe that King Cyrus, and his successor King Darius, would let returning exiles of a still subjected nation build a fortified structure on a mount overlooking the entire city? No occupying force would tolerate the most strategic location being controlled by their subjected people. Centuries later, that mount would see a stone Roman fort built on it, which then extended its walls around most of Jerusalem. And as a side note, part of the Temple, by Jewish Law, was off limits for any foreigner to ever enter. The Romans simply would not have allowed that within a fortified structure.

In conclusion, the exact location of the temple simply got confused over the years. The people were separated from the land for 18 centuries after the Diaspora, an event which left them hundreds of miles from that region, and then dozens of subsequent generations passed that lacked any in-person knowledge. So the temple’s location morphed during the Jews general absence from Israel, moving from near the mount - to the mount itself, the only constant landmark through the passing centuries."

https://apnews.com/article/gaza-hamas-demonstration-israel-blockade-palestinians-306b19228f9dd21f1036386ce3709672

(According to Kan11 region locked YouTube video) It started with that the electricity company in Gaza wanted to install a counter in a house of a 80 year old Palestinian, so they can measure the amount of electricity he uses and charge it for it, the man tried to stop them from doing so, a (likely verbal) fight started out during which the man has gotten an heart attack and died 

This coupled with that the welfare of poor Palestinian families from Qatar was reduced by 15$ (from 100) led to unrest among the Gazans leading to the protests 

Hamas obviously quickly shut down the protest, and as the saying goes, ""no Jews no news"", the protests at the time has barely gotten any coverage outside or Israeli media which also helped quiet things down. 

Now mthe questions I think that are worth discussing are, how likely are the protests to reignite?, if Hamas is toppled, what are the chances of a peaceful party to take their place? And which party would it be? And lastly, should Israel ""help"" the process in some way?"

1,2023-09-16,Introduction to Jewish Literature,u/BwanaAzungu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16kfwnn/introduction_to_jewish_literature/,"Hi everyone, 

First time poster, not at all familiar with this sub. 

I'm trying to expand my personal horizon, and I'm exploring some of the world's religions. Obviously Judaism is included in that endeavours. 

I'm looking for (English) literature that I can read, to get at least a surface-level understand of Judaism. 

I think it's safe to presume that the first thing to read would be the Torah. So my main question would be: 

What would you recommend as an easily accessible, yet sufficient English translation, of the Hebrew Torah? 

**Some personal context**

I've been born and raised in central Europe, and I'm familiar with at least its recent history. I speak our local language, but I'd say I have a better grasp on English; other languages escape me. 

I'm curious about all intellectual heritages. I've been raised in a christian environment (although not raised a christian). Obviously Judaism lies at the roots of christianity, as the first Abrahamic religion. 

Primarily I want to be open about my intentions: 

I'm not pretending to aim at anything deeper than a surface level understanding, at the moment. 

I'm interested in Judaism, as I'm interested in all ideologies. I wish to gain a rudimentary but true understand of it. And understand the limits of what I understand. 

My approach here is ultimately Humanist: 

I'm interested in how ideologies relate to one another. I plan to delve into christianity and islam subsequently. I'm fascinated by ancient Egyptian religion, while fully recognising how that society took advantage of the slaves. 

I'm interested in comparing and relating this to completely different ideologies, like African mythology or Eastern philosophy :)"

He had some seriously mind-boggling stories of the arms race that rages inside every high-security American prison. The creative lengths inmates would go to to make weapons would make McGyver proud. And in return, the brutal lengths the prison would go to to make the inmates' living spaces devoid of anything that could easily be made into a weapon are some grudgingly impressive feats of interior design. People determined to arm themselves will eventually find a way. Still, much can be done to slow and stymie their efforts, which seriously cut down on the number and severity of armed attacks.

I often hear Gaza referred to as ""the world's largest open-air prison"". I could see that, potentially. After all, at least ideally, prison is for people who've amply shown they cannot be trusted not to be a threat to the people they live amongst. Gaza's ruling regime clears that bar with no trouble. So does the majority of the Gazan populace, complicit in Hamas's deeds by their staunch support, as evidenced in numerous polls, surveys, and social media activity, including an official election.

Gaza fires a lot of heavy artillery at Israel. It's not particularly high-quality weaponry, and their marksmanship is almost comically bad. But rockets and missiles and bombs continue to get deployed. Where exactly are they getting them from?

A lot of people will simply answer ""Iran"", and consider that the last word on the topic. Sometimes Russia and/or Pakistan will also get thrown in for good measure. To me, though, that answer just kicks the can down the road. If there's such an impenetrable blockade by Israel and Egypt on every front, how are Iran and friends managing to bypass it? And if they're managing to bypass it, just how effective — or oppressive, for that matter — a blockade is it??

What I suspect is going on, is that most of Gaza's weaponry that gets aimed at Israel is homemade, using components and ingredients that get past the blockade because they're vital to a lot else that goes on in Gaza besides weapon manufacture. I'm thinking agricultural fertilizers, vehicle fuel, and metal pipes, for starters. My question then is this: Is there a concerted effort on Israel and Egypt's part to research and source alternative materials to send to Gaza, that serve the same nonviolent purposes just fine, but are not nearly as easily useful for manufacturing projectile explosives? If not, I'd imagine because they see this as a fool's errand — there are too many possible things and recipes for making weaponry to cut off or replace them all, without severely diminishing Gaza's standard of living. This would make the place even more unstable, and raise the ire of the ""international community"" 🙄 to unprecedented levels."

My temple had multiple services and, as a convert in progress who has no idea when things are supposed to happen, assumed from a conversation with my cantor and other temple-goers that I could attend the 2 pm service and get the full RH liturgy.

I brought a Jewish friend (plus a roommate) and she didn’t seem to question the time at all, so I didn’t question it either. About halfway through the service I realized something was a lot different from what I’d been expecting and started to get very nervous. It only lasted an hour and seemed to be a very condensed version for families with young kids. My friends had a good time, but I was just getting more and more nervous that I was at the “wrong” service.

Afterwards my cantor asked me if I went to a service last night, and my stomach dropped. I realized I’d missed the one I was “supposed” to go to. I just shyly told her I hadn’t gone anywhere and felt horrible when she looked disappointed in me. I don’t know how I’m going to attend Shabbat services next week without wanting to sink into the floor the whole time.

I feel awful. More than that, I feel stupid. I guess next year I’ll be able to attend the proper one and I can still do what I can for the rest of the HHDs, but damn am I really upset about it. It might not be something that matters to some people, but it really matters to me. 

I guess I’m just looking for advice or reassurance that I’m not the only person to have done this? Surely someone else has done this too, right? Maybe? I don’t know. I just feel really dumb and like I’ve disappointed God."

1,2023-09-16,I feel isolated from my Jewish culture and beliefs and there's not much I can do about it.,u/medUwUsan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16kj8b3/i_feel_isolated_from_my_jewish_culture_and/,"I (16F) was born to a Jewish father and a Christian mother in the Scottish Highlands. I know this technically doesn't make me Jewish but I still grew up celebrating Chunukka and being treated by peers as ""the Jewish kid"".

But that's where it gets rough; it doesn't get much deeper than that.

My Dad is a staunch Athiest who was raised Jewish but struggles to identify with it. Must of his descriptions of Judaism feel writhe with internalised anti-semetism and feeling although it only ever constrained him. He likes pork. He felt stressed trying to get my siblings circumcised since the nearest Rabbis refused to see to him since my mother wasn't Jewish. Then ended up deciding not to go through with it because he saw no point. 

I feel like most of my Jewish family don't feel connected to their heritage and the only event I've attended was my Sabba's online funeral during COVID, and they live in the US so I rarely get to see them in person. 

I can't celebrate Shabbat because of life issues with my family. The nearest Synagogue is hours away and I can't drive. I don't speak Hebrew and have too much goin on in my life to be able to learn it. Not that other languages have ever come to me naturally.

When I express my issues to my Dad he just says ""if you feel guilty about it, you're Jewish"". The most Jewish thing about me is the anti-semetism and harassment I face in school. Neo-nazis fucking suck and I've even been sexually threatened by one.

I don't even know if I can bring myself to believe in a higher power. Do I have to be religious to celebrate the cultural elements?

I don't want to let this part of me die. I can't be another basic lost person in this sea of identity crisis I'm surrounded by. Everyone's the same. They dress the same, they talk the same, they hate the same. I want out of it. I want to have something that connects me to my ancestors and the struggles they've faced. They fought to protect their culture, I can't discard of it.

But I grew up alienated from everything and I don't know what to do."

Am I being dramatic?,u/shmieve,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/16klidr/feeling_weird_about_professors_comment_am_i_being/,"For context: I’m in a doctoral program at a well-regarded, Baptist university in the US. I’m the only Jewish person in my very small cohort. While the university is Baptist, my program is considered non-denominational and there are no religious requirements.

I’m taking a class in cognitive behavior therapy right now. For those of you who don’t know, the main principle of CBT is basically that it’s your thoughts that cause you to experience negative emotions, not events themselves. My professor was asking us to “name something horrible,” and my Jewish ass said “the Holocaust.” The professor proceeded to ask me if I had read Maus or Man’s Search for Meaning, and said that the authors of those books clearly didn’t think the Holocaust was that terrible. He then said that things aren’t actually terrible, but they existed on a scale of “subjective inconvenience.” 

Although I understand his point from the CBT lens, I couldn’t help but feel a little offended.  While he didn’t say it verbatim, I felt like he was pretty much implying that the Holocaust was just inconvenient. To be fair, he had no reason to believe that anyone in the class was Jewish or the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors, and I was probably baiting him by bringing up the Holocaust in the first place. I don’t think it was his intention to be offensive. There aren’t really any other Jewish people where I’m living right now, so I just wanted to get y’all’s take on this. Do you think my professor was being antisemitic or am I just being overly dramatic? 

Side note: when he wrote the example on the board he also spelled it “the Holicost” (lol)"

I 32F converted to Judaism via a Conservative beit din after 10+ years of living/practicing Judaism. I currently daven with a Conservative synagogue.

I met my boyfriend 32M on Birthright. He is not Torah observant; his (South African) family is not observant. They eat pork, eat challah on Friday nights but do paid work/use electronics/drive on Shabbat and are surprised at people who go to shul. My boyfriend grew up going to a Chabad-run synagogue and promptly stopped going after becoming bar mitzvah.

Nonetheless they all consider themselves 'Orthodox', apparently meaning halachicly 'Jewish bloodline'. I have been told that I am 'second class' Jewish. Jewish but just 'not really part of the tribe'. Better than being a goy, but not by much. His grandmother belongs to a Reform synagogue -- even offered me her HHD tickets as she is not going, assuming, I guess, that I wouldn't have tickets even though she knows that I attend shul regularly and has nice things to say about my synagogue's rabbi. When asked though, she would insist that she is Orthodox.

We have an acquaintance from Birthright who converted with the Orthodox beit din who is far less observant than I am (and never intended to adopt the mitzvot as binding on her, but just wanted to be 'accepted by everyone'.) She has expressed the immense amount of shame and stress that this has caused her. My boyfriend sees no problem with this and has suggested that I could just do whatever it takes to be Orthodox Jewish, like he is and his family are. I have explained that I am willing to undergo an Orthodox conversion if it matters to him, but we would have to commit to being Orthodox: move to walking distance of an Orthodox shul, would have to be kosher in our home, would have to live apart, and would have to be sincere in living a Torah observant life, including being shomer Shabbat, shomer negiah, niddah, having/birthing/raising at least two Jewish children if possible, etc.

He has no interest in having children (we are on the same page about this.)

I'm not interested in lying or pretending that I will adopt practices that I do not intend to adopt (though maybe I would adopt them! Maybe learning more would lead me to a more observant life.). He also doesn't want me to lie and also has zero interest in those practices. (He attends shul now intermittently because it matters to me. He has used having a 'Jewish girlfriend' to support his application for a job working for a Jewish organisation \[which rosters him on for Shabbat(!)\])

I try to tone down my observance with his family, in part because they are not so observant and seem put off by people who are more observant. They also seem a bit surprised/offended that the second-class Jew does/knows Jewish things (e.g. that I would know to fast on YK; I mentioned going to do Taschlich to his mom and she was surprised, didn't know what that was, was kind of irritated that I was doing something 'religious'; boyfriend got upset and accused me of making things up when I mentioned that single men are supposed to light Shabbat candles if there is no one else lighting them. He later said oh, you were right, when we found information to that effect on Chabad's site.)

I was invited to another family's home for RH dinner last night as part of a 'host young Jewish people who don't have families in town program; this family also stated they were 'Orthodox' but on occasion, if they were to attend synagogue, attended the Reform synagogue (and are members of the Reform synagogue.) They had uncharitable things to say about people who are shomer shabbat and who do (what I consider to be) Orthodox practices. (A Modern Orthodox friend of mine who was also family-less was unable to attend this home for RH dinner as the family does not keep kosher to Orthodox standards.)

I know this is a their problem, not a my problem. But I feel devastated. Absolutely devastated. I took down the mezuzot in the apartment my boyfriend and I share. I took off my hamsa which I've worn constantly for 10+ years. I pulled all my Jewish books off of my bookshelf. I do'nt feel able to go to make taschlich today, and feel terrible.

I feel really sad. I am happy to do the Orthodox conversion and just be officially considered Jewish by everyone. It seems silly though to me, and possibly disingenuous, but I also don't know what the point is of any of this. Head is going to very dark places. I moved to this city and the Jewish community is fairly small. Just feel really really sad and really really bad. I don't know what to do.

My boyfriend also feels terrible; says that of course I'm Jewish, and to stop being so silly, but also insists that it would be 'easier' if I were to be 'Orthodox'. I've been invited to break the fast with his family after going to RH dinner on Friday with them. (We usually go to his grandmothers' places for Friday night dinners.)

I knew that I would not be considered Jewish by Orthodox standards when I converted, and that was fine with me. What I don't get and understand, and what feels so so hurtful, is for people to say they're Orthodox, be less practicing/observant, and then judge me both for practicing Judaism/observing mitzvot and also for not being 'bloodline' Orthodox. I feel like I can't do anything right.

Breaking up with the boyfriend is I guess an option but these South African 'Orthodox' Jews are a huge part of the community here. And these people that go to the same conservative synagogue apparently have this belief.

I guess what I'm asking is can I convert some other way? Or just some empathy? I feel betrayed. Like I can't seek support at synagogue and I can't seek support from friends (most Jewish friends are Reform/Conservative). I moved countries following conversion so my converting rabbi is no longer available."

Hello! I'm in a relationship with a Jewish enby and they've mentioned before that they'd like to get a mezuzah for our apartment!

 Personally I practice witchcraft, and they've been so supportive of my practice and spiritual journey. Recently I've made witch bells to put on our door, and thought it would be a good idea to show them I support their beliefs as well by getting us a mezuzah for the door.

I'm particularly crafty and love to make things by hand if I can. I'm aware that the scroll inside the mezuzah, I would have to purchase, but I have read that the casing for the scroll can be made by hand. I'm very new to Judaism, so I'm wondering if it would be okay for a non-jewish person to make the casing for the mezuzah by hand as a gift? Or is it more respectful to just buy one online? Is it possible I might be able to find one to buy locally? (Halifax, NS)

I'm very lost and do not know where to look. I really want it to be a surprise gift to show my partner I support them. Any advice, or tips would be so helpful ❤️"

>Exodus 35:1 Moses gathered the entire community of Israelites and said to them, “these are the things that Yahweh commanded you to do: 2  For six days physical labor can be done, but on the seventh day you will have a sacred cessation, a cessation for Yahweh; anyone who does physical labor on it will be put to death. 3  You cannot burn a fire in any of your settlements on the day of cessation. 

My question is regarding 35:3 'You cannot burn a fire in any of your settlements on the day of cessation'. This is never commanded by Yahweh. Why is this here and what is the meaning of this? Is kindling fire considered labor and Moses just included it as an example of what should not be done? But kindling fire is not considered labor in any other tradition from this time. Is it considered labor now in Judaism?"

I'm new to this sub and I have an ethical/practical question.  Before I ask it, please know that I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad or judged for their choices.  I have members of my extended family that I love and who have not struggled with this choice, but I'd just like to get a wider field of input.

My car is on its way out and we've decided to get an EV.  Luckily, there are many choices out there these days.  I've looked at a lot of great choices, and it's pretty close.  Telsas have these advantages: I have to drive from the East coast into the Midwest 2 -3 times per year, which means that I would need reliable charging, which Tesla is known for.  It's also, at least $5k less than anything else.

My problem/question:  I left Twitter (x, whatever)  when Musk took over.  As was inevitable, he's cut the value of the company in half and it seems to have become a safe space for hate, including literal Nazis.  Instead of blaming horrible business decisions, including reduced or non-existent moderation,  he is now seems to be openly blaming ""the Jews,"" threatening to sue the ADL for that loss of value because the ADL has simply pointed out that Twitter has become an online cesspool.

Where does the moral argument for and against buying a Tesla today stand for you?  Assuming an EV is affordable, is there a viable rationalization for you?  Or, is it a ""no way I'm giving this guy my money now,"" situation?  Again, those of you who own Teslas, no shade or judgement, though I'm curious how you're feeling about it now: would you get another?  Why or why not?"

I'm a Christian but I've long noticed that Jesus when translated uses the word Gehenna not hell. I've researched and found little information online about this place. I understand its a belief from second temple period Judaism (Jesus was himself a second temple period Jew) and onwards

Im looking to write a book about faith from an abrahamic standpoint and id love to know more about the Jewish belief of Gehenna. Is it like hell in traditional christianity? What Jewish sources can I use to learn more about this? What is your own understanding of Gehenna if its apart of your belief or you're knowledgeable? Thank you!"

Just so you know, not all of us are like that. Tho still, antisemitism in Eastern Europe is definitely a huge issue that we get extremely offended if anyone acknowledges that it exists"

Normally I would just call my therapist, but can't right now. So I wanted to check, Is this what has been going through your heads as well and  are my worries reasonable?

What it is looking like: Every statistic I am finding literally everywhere says that antisemitism has never been as bad as it is now in the US (I keep looking, I can't find anything that contradicts it). More and more in the public conscious it seems like people are acting as if jewish americans are foreigners, as if our interests are automatically more aligned with isreal than our home country. People like ye  are calling for limits on jewish employment. There are literal nazi rallies.

It seems to me that it is unavoidable that by 2025 laws will be pushed which start treated jewish people as if we weren't  american citizens, and are forigners. Then discussions of our religion will be considered damaging and be silenced by Kosa and whatever law project 2025 pushes. Then politicians will try to force all jewish people to emmegrate to isreal. Than, folks like me who litterally CAN'T emigrate for hard to explain reasons, will be stuck here and then stripped of assets and forced into awful situations. And eventually killed. And during every stage of that antisemitism will get worse and people will be killed in the streets by nazis. And then from 7 years from now all american jews will either be out of America or will be dead.

Is that reasonable? Can someone please find me something literally anywhere with proof that says this won't happen?

My maternal grandmother escaped Nazi Germany, but was always very adamant that she wasn't Jewish. My maternal grandfather just didn't talk about his family at all except that they were from Belarus,  but again they were very adamant about not being jewish. You'd think if they weren't Jewish they wouldn't feel so intense about proving it. I remember when I learned about the haulocaust in school and started asking questions about my ancestry and my mom got very intense telling me that even if we did have Jewish ancestry, to not tell anyone, even my dad and my best friends. 

As I got older, it became more and more clear the intergenerational trauma my family experienced, to the point that they completely blocked out and denied a huge swath of their history. It became obvious that my grandfather was jewish once I dug and found out that he'd legally changed his last name in his 20s from an undeniably jewish last name to a very ""normal"" American sounding one. I always found it strange that he never once talked about his upbringing or family, but it's clear he felt some sort of way about it...shame? Fear? 

My grandmother at some point before she died admitted that her father had had ""some"" jewish ancestry, but again once I did some digging (after my grandmother died, she was born in 1920), I come to disocover that her father was fully jewish, and there are records of him (that I can't fully decipher) that connect him to persecution by the nazis. 

When I told my mom my results, she sort of freaked out and started screaming about how she didn't want to be murdered and I can't trust anyone with this information because we don't know where this country (US) will be in the years to come and my friends now could become enemies later. 

I don't know, it makes me feel so sad that this part of my family history was cut off and denied, obviously stemming from horrible trauma. It actually makes me cry I feel so sad about it. Trying to process it all, and thought I'd post here because my mom's words did get to me and I am now feeling anxious and worried about telling anyone...(even though most people who meet me actually assume I'm jewish I don't know why exactly, but my whole life I've been conditioned to deny that I am)."

Today my family were out for lunch and encountered a group of (I believe) Ashkenazi folk, and for the time they were having their meal they would pass around their Shofar and take turns blowing it for different lengths and patterns. They had already been in the restaurant when we arrived, and we were sitting for just under and hour before they left. The whole time they were blowing their horn again and again. 

I understand that this is a religious practice and I try my very best as often as possible to be understanding about things I might think are strange simply because I've never been exposed to it. But this honestly just seemed very rude and inconsiderate to me? I did a small bit of research and I know now that there is a holiday happening, and I know a little bit about the practice in general, but in the - admittedly shallow - amount of researching that I've done I didn't see anything about doing this specifically at meals, or in public, or at the very least in an area in which people can't really leave if the sound bothers them.

So I thought I'd ask the experts and maybe gain a bit of insight on the situation and know a bit more about what was going on and perhaps the reason behind why they chose to do this in this particular location. Thank you and I hope you are all having a pleasant holiday!"

I live in an area (central Alberta, Canada) without many Jews (either in ethnicity or religion) and have met none that I know of, so I thought I'd ask here as I think it's the right sub? (If not, my apologies and certainly direct me elsewhere!)

I am curious about rabbinic interpretation of the Torah and the rest of the writings in the Tanakh with regards to children in the womb. For one, is it believed that these children have a soul from the moment of conception? Or does ensoulment happen at some later time in the pregnancy? I read somewhere that Jewish belief is that ensoulment happens partway through the pregnancy, possibly at the moment the first movement is felt (quickening)? But I never saw a source for this.

Also, I am curious about Jewish interpretation of what in my Bible is Numbers 5:11-31, which some people interpret as a procedure for an abortion, done by a priest with bitter water, when a wife has committed adultery.

I ask these questions as I was raised with the conservative Christian view that all abortion, no matter how early, is murder, because the unborn are people and have a soul. Also, that children of believers lost through miscarriage will be reunited with their families in heaven. I understand that these views obviously have ramifications for how we think about abortions in general, and am researching different views on the subject.

It’s one of the oldest Ashkenazi communities in the world, and I’ve been raised in the Ashkenazi tradition.

Me and my whole family are very dark skinned and Jews often assume I’m Israeli.

I’ve always put it down to the fact that Ashkenazim come in all skin tones and all Jews originally come from Israel anyway.

However, I’ve also read that after the inquisition a lot of Sephardi Jews were incorporated into the Ashkenazi community of Alsace. 

I know that records that far back are difficult, but does anyone have any suggestions as to how I might be able to trace my lineage back even further? And/or if I was descended from a Sephardi immigrant, would this show up in a blood test or would it be too long ago with too much interbreeding to show?

If my family were to join a Conservative synagogue, would it be a problem that my son hasn’t been circumcised? (I know nobody’s checking in kids’ pants but would they ask for a record of his bris?) If he decides he wants to be Conservative when he’s an adult, will he need to be circumcised then?

I have read books about it, but I feel embarrassed about what the next step is. I want to experience the religion fully. I have found a synagogue near me that seems great and has values I agree with. Am I allowed to reach out as a non Jewish person? Can I attend without being Jewish? I hope these questions make sense. Thanks for any help!"

תיזכו לשנים רבות ואנייאדה דולסה אי בואנה!
I just posted this inquire on a Facebook group, but I would like to expound my audience to receive more answers.

 I recently learned that the sephardi siddur with the Livirno Text is still in the market. So I wanted to ask two questions.
If you are familiar with any of the following editions, what may be the difference between them? Either in book quality or text (I already know that the current editions have maghrebi additions, but I have maghrebi ancestry so it works perfectly to me).

●Tefilat Hachodesh from Machon Seforno: http://sforno.co.il/product/tefilat-hachodesh-hashalem-big-brown/

●Tefilat hachodesh or vishua: https://www.orvishua.com/product/%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A8-%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%97%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A9-%D7%9E%D7%94%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94-%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%99%D7%94/

●Tefilat Hachodesh anash editions: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100092883308879&mibextid=ZbWKwL

And perhaps more importantly, can we find any of those editions within the USA? 

Finally,  what may be the difference between those and the siddur Ish Maṣliah?  I read that Ish Maṣliach has levornese influences too. And is maghrebi as well. 

Thank you so much and שנה טובה ומתוקה!"

At Conservative synagogues nowadays, do most people stay home on Erev Rosh Hashanah and not attend services? I grew up belonging to a Conservative shul, and we always went to services on Erev RH. I don't really remember the logistics of dinner; I think we just ate really early. The synagogue was always packed on that night. I attended with my family into the mid 2000s and then moved away, so I'd attend random Hillel or nontraditional services (yet still always went on Erev RH!).

At my new synagogue (a traditional Conservative shul) on Erev RH this year, my son was the only child in the whole place. Vast empty rows all around us dotted with a person or two here and there. More people nearer the bimah (it was assigned seating), but still a very sparse crowd.

Then, both days of RH were very well attended and full of kids in the hallways and at kids' programming.

Do most people, especially families with kids, just not attend on Erev RH anymore? I guess this question is specifically about Conservative congregations, but I am also curious about the general trend across all types of synagogues."

My maternal grandparents came from Eastern Europe, grandfather from somewhere in Poland.  Grandmother from Ukraine, specifically L'wow..or at least this is what we were told.  Side note:  grandfather was dead long before I was even a thought.

Babci never spoke of her life in Ukrainę, she was a holocaust survivor so this is understandable.  All she would say is that she lived a life of luxury prior to the wat.  During the war she hid on a farm, sleeping in the attic and tending to farm chores during the day.  Other than this no one in the family could pry details from her, she would always get suspicious of us if we pressed too hard.
Mom was reading a book last year about the holocaust.  In this book was a lot of slang that Polish and Ukraine jews would use.  Words that my mother grew up hearing babci use.


All our lives the family has had suspicions that we may be of Jewish descent.  Unfortunately i can't find squat on ancestry.com, all I know is: 1. they came over in the late 50s; 2. Mom is the only one born on u.s. soil; 3. Aunts and uncles don't remember squat of the old country.

Mom recently had an idea to speak with a Ukraine rabbi to see if maybe they can help determine anything, or at the very least point us in the right direction.  Ok, great, all for it.  I don't know how to contact one over there.

Any help would be appreciated."

1,2023-09-18,My experience as a patrilineal orthodox convert,u/Prettybarbiegirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/16lqr1i/my_experience_as_a_patrilineal_orthodox_convert/,"Hi. I was raised Jewish. I feel culturally Jewish. Those are the only traditions I know, but low and behold, I’m a fellow patrilineal. This has caused loads of hardship and emotional pain for me, and I’ve even decided to do an orthodox conversion to be Halachically recognized by all sects, (and of course to feel closer to hashem and my religion).
But anyways, that’s besides the point. I want to talk about how hard it is growing up patrilineal especially when you hit your teen years, and maybe this will remind other Jewish people to be kinder and more accepting of patrilineal Jews.
So growing up, my only culture, traditions, and beliefs were Jewish. My dad is Jewish, my only family  that I actually know Is Jewish, and I went to Hebrew school, religious Jewish school, and synagogue all the time growing up. I don’t know much about any outside traditions; even from my moms side because my moms family lives in a different country, and my mom never instilled her beliefs or traditions into the home. So my dads culture was the dominant culture.  Growing up, I had a Jewish life. I felt Jewish. Until I hit my teen years, things got more complicated. I found out that I am not accepted as a Jew, despite my whole life and belief system being centered around Judaism. At this point in my life, I was exploring religion and spirituality and I felt a strong calling to become more religious and wanted  to explore Orthodox Judaism. I accepted that I wasn’t considered Halachically Jewish, and respected their beliefs. This would’ve been fine if the people in orthodox settings were more respectful, but I was ostracized by rabbis, orthodox jews etc etc. I would’ve been fine with them not viewing me as Jewish if they were respectful and kind about it, but they were horrible to me! Very rude, making snarky backhanded comments, and just in all not treating me very well. Even the rabbi at this time ostracized me. It made me feel horrible and so out of place. After my experiences with Orthodox Judaism, I completely withdrew at that point. It made me not want to explore my religious path more and completely alienated me.  This should not be a thing! I understand that orthodox does not consider us patrilineal Jews,  Jews, but please, be kind to us. There is no need to ever ostracize us, or make snarky rude comments. It can be very damaging and hurtful. Be respectful. If a patrilineal Jew is in a orthodox space, they’re probably looking to do a Halachic conversion anyways.

Despite me having a negative experience with rabbis and orthodox communities, I still got back on my feet and found different orthodox rabbis and communities. I am going through with an orthodox conversion soon! And I’ll be halachically jewish. It has been a long, difficult journey for me. Full of hardship and pain, but I didn’t let judgement between rude people get in the way of my journey between hashem and I.  I have found a wonderful orthodox rabbi, who is very kind and supportive of my journey and the orthodox community I am in now is also very kind and accepting. I am so excited to be Jewish by Halacha, but still, that won’t discredit my prior experience I went through with my journey in Judaism. 

Please be kind to patrilineal Jews. A lot of them don’t know any other community besides the Jewish one, being kind to them doesn’t mean you are going against Halacha, it just means that you treat them with kindness and respect, and don’t ostracize them from the community even if you don’t technically consider them to be Jewish. Thank you"

I then went to live with my mother and her new partner and my mother's two (non-Jewish) sons from a  previous marriage. Also the area I lived in and the school I attended had very few Jews. This was all a source of a lot of trouble and anti-Semitism. Having a Jewish name but living totally outside the Jewish community gave me the worst of all worlds. 

Have other members of this group had similar experiences? I guess I'm talking about the feeling of displacement experienced by 'lost half-Jews' - even though some people don't like this self-description.

However, I still did not really understand the theological difference between reform and Reconstructionist Judaism. I suppose there’s more secular Jews in latter one, but both fall under the term progressive judaism and I’m just not aware of any *real* theological differences right now .

In the past I have contributed to such organizations as the ALCU, ADL, and others, but looking for something that is more pro Israel as Israel is intended (Jewish State). 

Any suggestions will both be appreciated as well as researched. I want to ensure that any dollar I contribute has a large portion that goes to help people and/or the cause, vs Organizations that have high overhead or F&A expenses.

My dad and mom are agnostic, although I grew up celebrating the ‘bigger’ holidays with the rest of my family. 

I want to explore more religious ways of living, as of now I dress modestly, eat ‘kosher’, try to celebrate shabbat, and I’m studying for a bat mitzvah (despite my age of 17, I wanted a bat mitzvah at 11 but my dad discouraged me)

First of all, the only orthodox community near me is Chabad… Second, they don’t even consider me Jewish. I feel that converting would be disingenuous when I don’t know enough about how orthodox Jews really live.

Additionally, at my college there are no Jewish organizations on campus and I am not in a place to be creating one. This is very disappointing to me as I was looking to explore my religion more in college :(

I consider myself fully Jewish culturally because of my mother’s emotional absence growing up, and the fact that her family lives overseas so I only see them once every few years. My father’s family is mostly reform."

Me and my girlfriend just finished our tour of Tiberias lake (kinneret trail). For this trip we bought a 2 places tent (Decathlon) and 2 ground sheets (Decathlon) for 140+28= 178 shekels.

We don't plan to use it in Israël again and we live the country in 1 week (27 september 2023) so we are looking for selling it for less than half price: 80 shekels / 20 euros.

The tent is complete and in a good state, just a bit of dust on it (no holes, no scares) and the ground sheets are still useable (not cutted or destructed).

I have a question for the pro-Palestinians here in this subreddit: do you actually believe the claims your movement regularly makes?

Do you actually believe Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians?
Do you actually believe Israel is treating the Palestinians just like the Jews were treated by the Nazis?
Do you actually believe that settlement construction is forcing the Palestinians out of the West Bank and that eventually there will be none left?
Do you actually believe that Hamas' rocket attacks aren't dangerous and don't pose a threat to Israeli lives?
Do you actually believe that Israel currently poses an ""existential threat"" to the Palestinians?
Do you actually believe Palestinian stone throwing isn't violent or is ""peaceful protest,"" even though more than 15 Israelis have been killed by it?
Do you actually believe that Palestinian terrorism, such as the knifing to death of senior citizens and small children in the streets of Tel Aviv, is self-defense and the only thing preventing Israel from committing genocide?
Do you actually believe that because more Palestinians have been killed in the conflict than Israelis, that constitutes proof that the Palestinians are in the right?
Do you actually believe that Israel is a ""racist state"" and an ""ethnostate"" simply because it is a Jewish state?
Do you actually believe all Israelis are legitimate targets, including children, because Israel has a draft?
Do you actually believe that Israel does things like fight Hamas and build checkpoints/security fences in order to make Palestinian lives harder, or because they are racist against Palestinians, and not out of a desire to protect their people from terrorism?

Do you actually believe these things, or do you just say them out of a sense of loyalty to your cause and/or a desire to get a rise out of your opponents?

Now what I'm expecting is silence from the pro-Palestinians here who do say these things, and to hear ""I don't actually believe these claims, and I have never said them"" from the rest.

To the pro-Palestinian people who do not believe these claims and do not say them, I have a question for you:

Why are you part of a movement that consistently says things you don't believe and promotes views that you do not share?

Thank you in advance for your thoughts."

Hope you all had a great Rosh Hashanah! Yom Kippur starts next Sunday evening, and I want to put together a care package for the parents of a little girl I used to babysit. They are orthodox and observant, and I remember last year they were discussing what to eat before nightfall so the fast would be easier on them. 

I am thinking of putting together a basket with nutritious foods that provide long-lasting energy and get digested slowly (hope that makes sense, I’m running on not nearly enough caffeine lol). Obviously I am making sure that everything is certified kosher (they eat anything that has any kind of kosher certification on it) and parve so they can eat it regardless of whether they’ve had meat or dairy. 

So far on my list:

- A bag of roasted pistachio (they’re not allergic). 
- A couple of bags of dried fruit (apricots, mangoes, raisins). 
- Electrolyte drinks (probably Gatorade or Vitamin Water if they are certified Kosher, I’ll have to check). 
- Possibly white flowers already arranged in a vase so they don’t have to do it (are flowers ok for Yom Kippur?). 
- Maybe caramel rice cakes?
- A card wishing them an easy fast. 

Please let me know what else you would like to have if you were receiving a Yom Kippur care package! 

Thank you so much in advance."

You've given me, us, a lot to think about and discuss and I appreciate you taking the time for a (mostly) frank conversation. And thanks to the mods for allowing an anonymous post. Maybe it'll be as fruitful for some future redditor.


Throwaway account because I'm still unpacking this but an earlier post really struck me, and maybe I just need a place where people will understand. For context, my wife and I are both patrilineal Jews who grew up with varying degrees of observance. My wife is admittedly more observant than I am, but we attend shul regularly, our daughter goes to Sunday school, etc. We consider ourselves Jewish. At least, I thought we did. 

Awhile back, my wife asked what I thought about attending Orthodox services. I wasn't opposed but curious since my wife is very active and seems happy in our current congregation. That's when she told me she's considering an Orthodox conversion for herself and ""for future generations."" She has rationalized that if she converts, our 5yo daughter will have a much easier time (and may only require a symbolic mikvah), and our daughter's children will be halachially Jewish. I'm ashamed to admit I was initially dismissive, but further discussions have revealed this is something my wife feels very strongly about. She has an inate desire to do this so our daughter and her potential future children will not have their identity questioned the same way my wife and I have. It's not her only reason, but I think it's higher on her list than even she realizes.

It's admirable in many ways. But the whole idea honestly makes me very sad too, because I understand my wife's motivations. I know that she's trying to protect our daughter in every way she knows how. Obviously, I'll support her any way I can, but I just feel so bad that she feels the full weight of this. For her part though, my wife is extremely happy that we're having these conversations, and I know she'll pour her whole heart into the process should she decide to continue. She's an amazing woman, and I'm so lucky to have her. I know it's stupid to kvetch about my wife wanting what she thinks is best for our family. I guess I just wish she didn't feel such an obligation because of the divides within our own community, and I'm not sure how to feel about any of it."

>Petlyura’s Cossacks were not the “real” Cossacks – members of the closed militarized communities that served Russian Tsars and in the Russian army, and who later joined the Denikin Army. In the first half of 1919, the term “Cossacks” was very often used to refer to the soldiers of the new Ukrainian People’s Army. They were sometimes also called “New Cossacks.”  Those soldiers were Ukrainian recruits and volunteers, often local peasants.

So far this is the only source I've scene that touches on this aspect of the accounts archived at the YIVO institute, I'd be very interested to know of any books that cover this question, English or not."

He also likely isn't doing all this to skip the trial, I know that most of you will disagree with this statement, but high level politicians, even in democracy, have a very easy time to escape Jail - Kachav who was accused of rape (far bigger crime than corruption) was offered a plea deal where he wouldn't sit in jail for one day

Initially, it was a real honor to carry on these cherished traditions. But as the years have gone by, we've started to feel a growing sense of frustration.Our gatherings have grown to include around 30 people, but only about six of us actively practice Judaism. The rest fall across the spectrum from being secular to irreligious, and we even have some who identify as Christian. So, what were once gatherings meant to honor the significance of these holidays have evolved into irreverent family dinners where people come and go as they please and talk over the prayers, seemingly oblivious to the occasion's importance. Despite our best efforts, polite reminders, and occasionally more assertive attempts, nothing seems to change. I reached my breaking point last weekend and my husband is also very frustrated.We're now considering hosting separate family get-togethers during the non-holiday seasons, reserving the religious holidays exclusively for practicing Jewish family and friends. However, we're grappling with the worry that this might inadvertently weaken the already fragile connection to Judaism among our younger Jewish relatives.Have any of you faced similar challenges in mixed families? How have you managed to strike a balance that respects tradition while nurturing the bonds of faith and family? We'd greatly appreciate your wisdom and experiences as we weigh this delicate decision."

Part of me would love to systematically go through this article to point out all the ways it doesn't make sense, but I'm honestly not enough of a scholar to feel confident in my teardown.

My FIL and I generally have a peaceful relationship, in that he doesn't aggressively try to convert me, but I know he thinks I'm going to hell and genuinely believes it's a righteous thing to save my soul (and my husband's, who left the church before we met.) We usually just don't talk about religion and our conversations focus on the things we do share, like a love for our family and travel.

Would you address this post if this was your FIL? Ignore it? It really annoys me that he tagged me in this, but maybe my reaction is a little blind and the article is not that bad?"

When we say selichot (almost the entire Neilah Service), we recite the 13 attributes of Hashem many times.

The plain reading is that we are invoking these attributes as part of asking Gd for forgiveness — to remember our covenant and to forgive because he is merciful, slow to anger and so forth. 

The new idea that resonates more with me:
We invoke the 13 attributes of Gd because those are the 13 attributes that we must emulate in order to do teshuva and earn Hashem’s forgiveness.  He will then treat us in kind— so if are merciful with your sinful neighbor, slow to anger with your frustrating child, and so forth, so too will Hashem be with you.

This is really important to talk about because this was an antisemitic act.

The ancient city of Jericho is a Jewish historical site.  Originally Canaanite, the city was conquered and expanded. 

UNESCO Doesn't even mention that connection 

[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1687](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1687)

&#x200B;

In fact, this is the fifth world heritage site that UNESCO has identified in the State of Palestine. 

&#x200B;

All five are important Jewish historical place.  All five do not mention Judaism.

&#x200B;

This is Jewish erasure.

&#x200B;

""but its in Palestine, and heritage sites are listed by ownership""

&#x200B;

All the more reason to mention the Jewish connection. And my basis for my antisemitic claim.   This isn't a ""Israel Palestine"" issue. This is part of the systematic ethnic cleansing of the region.  Even from history.

&#x200B;

For example Battir, is a Jewish name originally. Betar.  One of the earliest examples of Tiered farming in hilled lands.  Even the name Betar isn't mentioned.

[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1492](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1492)

&#x200B;

Or ""Jesus's Birthplace""

[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1433](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1433)

Jesus was Jewish born in a Jewish town.   Is Judaism mentioned?  Not even once.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Jewish history is human history. We are one of the oldest people, and our contributions to the world's heritage must be acknowledged in full;

For those women who are modest in their clothes, meaning below the knee, usually skirts or dresses, chest covered, shoulders, not ALWAYS below the elbow or yes below the elbow, if you became more frum as an adult by choice, what was your experience going from exposure to modesty? Like socially? 

What changed for you, socially or personally, through becoming more modest (for halakhah)?

I don't want to get too into my experiences and risk anonymity, but basically, I believe that someone in my life who I was previously very close with may be projecting negative energy (evil eye) onto me in order to surpass me in our very niche shared field- or something similarly bad is happening. We're both Jewish so I'm seeking advice from anyone who knows anything about how to handle this from that approach. 

My experiences, mostly over the past week: increased sightings of dead animals (especially while traveling to interview-adjacent things), sleep paralysis of things in my room haunting me, nausea and not being able to digest food (no other illness), sudden loss of abilities important to our shared field, losing opportunities and unexpectedly failing at things I am qualified to succeed in (making room for the person in question to usurp the positions I'm going for). There are a few other strange happenings that would take too much explanation, also involving a family member that the person knows, but hopefully you get the picture. 

I am mostly secular, as are the people around me, but we feel convinced that there is something beyond us at play here or that a warning is being delivered, even if unrelated to the person I'm suspicious towards. Any advice on how to protect from this energy is appreciated. "

I’m just not sure what I should know or should look into further. I have a very basic understanding of Judaism and of what it means to be Jewish, because my paternal family only discovered they had Jewish ancestry about a decade ago when I found my great grandfather’s Jewish service card from WW2. (There’s a whole story as to how that’s even possible, I’d be happy to discuss it if anyone wants to know.)

I’m learning what’s kosher and have a basic understanding of most holidays like Yom Kippur and Hanukkah, but that’s about it. I’m a college student with a physical disability so driving to the local synagogue is out of the realm of possibility for me at the moment (mid-terms and can’t drive). I’m also just worried that I may be rejected since I’m not Jewish on my mother’s side and my family hasn’t practiced or even known they were Jewish for two whole generations.

Hoping for some “etiquette advice” regarding an upcoming funeral, burial, and memorial dinner for a family friend. This is the first funeral I’ve attended as an adult and definitely the first Jewish funeral I’ve attended.

My husband’s sister-in-law (the wife of my husband’s brother) unfortunately lost her grandfather today. She has become a close friend of mine and invited me to attend the funeral, burial, and a dinner to celebrate her grandfather’s life. Events begin tomorrow mid-morning, so I feel short on time!

In case this is necessary for any advice: My friend and her family are self-described “Russian Jews.” I don’t know if there are specific denominations, but I at least know that her immediate family isn’t particularly conservative. We are in NYC. My husband and her husband are both unable to attend, so I am the only non-Jewish person I know who will be in attendance.

**Is there anything I should send or bring? Flowers? Cultural foods or other gifts?** (I ask because I once sent babka to some coworkers around Rosh Hashana and they were “so touched”!)

**Beyond the obvious black/conservative clothing, is there anything specific I should or should not wear?** Should it definitely be a dress? Are tights/stockings recommended? Any requirements for my hair? (My SIL and family don’t cover their hair, but not sure if different for funerals!)

Fought face to face with angels, held together families of 70+ people wandering through the desert, and became fathers of many nations. Noah built a stadium sized boat out of chopped down trees, and restarted humanity after the flood. It takes some humongous XL sized balls capable of producing considerable sperm cells. Moshe led a successful rebellion of slaves, overthrew the Egyptians and led his people for 40 years barefoot through the desert surviving on magical bread and water from stones. Navy Seal shit.

Would there be any way for this couple to have a satisfying sex life without the wife essentially forcing herself to engage in parts she doesn’t enjoy? If they have no intention of having children and don’t engage in acts that could potentially result in pregnancy, would it still count as wasting seed?

Therefore, I don't understand why there is so little opposition to these pointless balloon releases. It has no religious significance. It's just a blatant disregard for wildlife and the planet.

(note: I'm generally bad at cooking: please break it down nice and simple)

Thank you all!

1,2023-09-19,how do I get “back in” to judaism?,u/Mammoth-Tea,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/16mlv6c/how_do_i_get_back_in_to_judaism/,"my parents are jew-ish, in that they were somehwat raised as jews but both at some point converted to mormonism. I wasn’t raised jewish whatsoever, and have never had a jewish social group or observed any traditions. I kind of want to get into it, because I understand it’s a very close community where people take care of each other. I’ve always enjoyed the acts of service culture from the mormons but they have so many other problems I cannot participate in that community anymore. 

I am agnostic/atheist, but from what I understand there’s a lot more to being jewish than the religion. i’m hoping that I can get the same level of community and closeness that mormonism had without all of the extra baggage that comes with hating gay people and coffee. 

my main concern is basically whether i’m really “jewish enough” to be accepted. and also, if I am how would I go about it? just show up to a synagogue one day??? idk how any of this works so please be patient with me :)"
1,2023-09-19,Teshuvah for Abusers,u/Muted_Highway5332,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/16mm1wu/teshuvah_for_abusers/,"CW: abuse, sexual assault 

I was having a dream that has become fairly common, an attempt at reconciliation with who I’ve referred to as my my rapist, abuser, but I am feeling immense empathy in this moment and will just call him S. His name used to have so much power over me but in this moment I feel loving care. The dream stopped feeling like a dream, I slowly started waking up through it, it started feeling like a plan.

I went to find him at his high school. I wanted to talk it all out. I missed my friend. We walked and eventually got in a cab. There was so much we wanted to talk about, just catch up about, after not having seen each other or spoken in 10 years. So we got a bit caught up. Eventually he said something about my behavior, my retaliation, and called it abusive. I said I hear you but I’m not comfortable talking about the response to the action without discussing the action first, and he respected that. We kept pretty much beating around the bush and planned to keep talking on his mom’s roof. I was nervous to go to his mom’s apartment, where I spent most of high school and many of my most traumatic moments. I started trying to actually get at what happened, and then I woke up. This is usually how these dreams go, lately they are friendly (they used to be me trying to punch him and the punch won’t go through) and then when i try to finally talk to him about the abuse, I wake up.

This is suddenly feeling very important to me. The consideration of my own actions in retaliation. I am not proud of how I acted. I am in complete empathy for how I acted and know that was what I needed at the time, but still, objectively I tried to cause harm. And I probably did. 

Its hard having no idea who he is now. A part of me feels like maybe he was a teenager caught up in an evil, sexually obsessed culture (late raunch culture circa 2010) with no parental support, and the other part of me feels he has some innate inability to care for other people. I tell myself he is a psychopath. It feels like that is the only way to grapple with what happened and my inability to ever process this with him, because that is just not done. Another part of our culture is when someone has sexually abused you, especially if they refuse to admit it, you shun them and likely publicly humiliate them.

In this moment- 4:40 AM- I am feeling heartbroken by my own actions. I want to make Teshuvah for them. I want to give him a chance to make Teshuvah for his. I did try this initially- 10 years ago- before I got into a revenge process- I did try to talk it out with him and was severely rejected. But I recognize that that was 10 years ago and just as I was a kid, so was he. 

I want to heal this fracture, for myself, for the God field, and even for him. I have engaged in every kind of healing work for myself to get past the effects of our relationship- years of EMDR therapy, I’ve spoken with the universe and worked to forgive him in my heart. I have come such a long way from the PTSD haze that once plagued me. But still, it never goes away. The fear and paranoia returns again and again in my wonderful, stable marriage. And these dreams continue to return again, ever evolving in tone. Tonight, I feel awoken. I wonder if I should leave them as they are, for my subconscious to work out in dream world, or if this is a fracture that can only be fully healed in reality, here in the world of Assiah. I am sitting here, at now 4:51 am, genuinely wanting to make Teshuvah with someone who has abused me."

What I mean is, if someone's last Jewish ancestor is from the 1700s, are they still Jewish? We see on this Reddit folks finding out their grandparents or great-grandparents were Jewish, but what if it goes further back? Is it still something of the ""Cherokee princess"" claim, or is it a valid claim to the tribe? Would such a person need to do a full conversion? 

I did a cursory look through the Internet to see if this had come up before, but most of what I found was for grand/great-grand, and I'm more curious about further back than that. What are the community's thoughts?"

He said kosher and halal animals are killed in an inhumane way and seemed to understand it as animal sacrifice/ ritual slaughter. I looked it up on Wikipedia and what he told me about the Sikh belief was very close to what was written there. It got a little heated even because I’m pretty sure Popeyes in Canada is halal and he was upset because he eats it. I told him my understanding about what Kosher meat means, that the animal is killed quickly and the blood drained, and a prayer said for the sake of the animal/ our gratitude for it and not as a sacrifice for God, but he has been taught it’s both a slow bleeding to death and a animal sacrifice.
Can you help me form a response please? He really is a nice kid trying to understand, not an antisemite attacking me.

Edit— thanks! Many of these responses were quite helpful. I do believe as a teacher that clarifying misconceptions about other ethnic groups is part of my job— I need to defend my own ethnic group from slander just as I’d defend his, and that kosher slaughter is purposefully cruel is slander. Sending him away free to believe anything he wants would be disrespectful to both of us. In a multicultural school, misconceptions come up often and I always do my best to give factual and fair information. We had a good conversation today where I told him I learned from our conversation yesterday and read up on it to understand it better and that I appreciate both our traditions want to minimize animal suffering and we discussed the ethics of eating spiders tigers. He’s a nice kid who gets bored and lonely and wants adults to engage with him."

I feel very triggered due to a past relationship in which my ex was unwilling to commit to orthodoxy.

I ask myself: am I being inflexible? Or should I only be dating people that are already shomer Shabbat and shomer kashrut?

That’s what I prefer….

Im BT so there’s some knowledge I lack, but he doesn’t understand melachot of Shabbat or basic Halacha or Hebrew… am I being harsh?

I want someone who already loves being shomer mitzvot and is b’simcha, not questioning"

Bemidbar Rabbah 14:20 says that his prophetic ability was on par with Moshe

Sotah 11a states that he was one of Pharaoh's advisors, and it was his idea to drown the Jewish children in Egypt

There's an account from the Yalkut Me’am Loez relating a whole story of a war in Kush during the period in between Moshe leaving Egypt and arriving in Midian, where Moshe and Bilaam were the advisors of the opposing sides

There's the incident with him advising Balak

And he is finally captured and executed after the fight against Midiyan, which was also the last battle of Moshe's life."

1,2023-09-19,"Patrilineal Jew, going through a really rough patch with my identity. Looking for any advice/help/words of encouragement.",u/WildDance1223,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16mz2v8/patrilineal_jew_going_through_a_really_rough/," Hello  all. Throwaway account - I simply do not want this story tied to the  account I use on a daily basis, as I keep my religious life off the  internet all together. I apologize for how long this may be, but I  simply don't know where else to go with this story right now.

To  start off - I'm almost 26 weeks pregnant and emotions are running high  regarding many things.  I'm just asking that while I do want honesty, to  please be kind as well. No one can make me feel worse about this  situation than I can, myself. I have tears building up in my eyes as I  write this.

I'm a Patrilineal Jew  and I understand what that means to some. I was not raised secular but  was never really raised within any particular movement - I would say  mostly conservative. I never believed in putting people in to distinct  categories within Judaism, and still don't. I celebrated the holidays. I  went to summer camp at the JCC from age 5 to my teens where I then  became a counselor. I still have my childhood mezuzah. My father's side  is 100% Ashkenazi Jews - My great grandparents fled Poland and Romania. I  grew up with his parents being my Bubbe (She passed when I was young)  and Zayde, whom I was very close to until his death. There were kids in  school who made less than nice remarks about me being Jewish, teased me,  used it against me as an insult, even. My mother is not Jewish and they  broke up when I was around 5 years old. They were an on again/off again  couple throughout my life and are not together anymore. My father was  my primary caretaker throughout my life as my mother was often absent  and has struggled with an addiction and severe alcoholism for as long as  I can remember. My childhood is filled with painful memories regarding  her and my parents' relationship as a whole. I have things I'm still  trying to get over. People who don't grow up with an addict for a parent  think they know what it feels like, but unless you've experienced it,  you have no idea whatsoever. She and I are estranged and have been for  many years... I'm not really here to discuss my relationship with her,  but it being that way has me better off.

I'm  now in my 30s and in the greatest relationship of my life, with a  (matrilineal) Jewish man. He isn't even everything I prayed for - He's  more than that. Other than my father, I had never met a man like him  before. He's loving, giving, compassionate, protective, funny,  intelligent, hardworking, and so much more. I met him on JSwipe not long  after I moved to the state we currently live in (Trying not to be too  descriptive incase any Jews I know in the area happen to be reading this  - who knows). He was the second guy I went on a date with from that app  (I had been on it briefly in my home state but had never went on a date  in person, just had conversations that ended up falling in to  nothingness or we didn't vibe enough to eventually set up a date). We  deleted the app at the end of our first date and have not been separated  since. We live together and do everything together. He's my rock and  support system. I try to be the best I can be on a daily basis not only  for him, but for myself and our son who is soon to be born. Our  relationship is everything I thought I would never have, but this is  standing in my way and feeling like I'll just never be enough.

As  I said earlier, I'm almost 26 weeks pregnant and we're expecting a baby  boy. We wanted to be married before having kids, but G-d apparently has  another plan. It was a surprise, but a very welcome one. I understand  that since my mother isn't Jewish, I'm not considered ""fully"" Jewish (or  at all), and our son/any future kids will face the same challenge. Me  and my boyfriend are not Orthodox, even though he had been in the past.  Judaism is very important to him, and on the app, he stated that he was  looking for a woman who wanted to be traditional, celebrate the  holidays, go to shul, and have a Jewish family. I want those same  things. I identified myself as ""Just Jewish"" (For those of you not  familiar with JSwipe, you can pick a category of that, Orthodox,  Conservative, Reform, Traditional, or Willing to Convert). I also lived  with relatives who were Orthodox and lived the Orthodox life in  Brooklyn. His Rabbi is Orthodox (Chabad) and he has known him since his  teenage years. His Rabbi, his wife, and their 10 kids are like family to  him. I've met them many times and they're all very nice to me. I go to  their shul, another Chabad shul that I went to before meeting my bf, and  also a conservative one in our area. I had only been to Orthodox shuls  throughout my life and started going to the conservative one a few  months ago to see what the experience was like. I thought that would be a  better fit for me. Neither of us are interested in reform, which is  another conversation that isn't really relevant. I understand that  reform sees patrilineal Jews as ""fully"" Jewish - But reform is not a  movement I wish to participate in. I'm not like a fish out of water when  I go to a service. I know what's going on and can follow along. I'm not  fluent in Hebrew, but am learning. I read within Judaism on a daily  basis. Chabad, MyJewishLearning, Times of Israel, many different  articles from other sites and I have the Torah and commandments easily  accessible on my phone.

I'm 2  months and 10 days away from my due date, and my bf still has not told  these people that we're expecting. I'm a smaller woman and am showing  now, so there's really no hiding it. It was my understanding that the  Orthodox generally won't mention it/bring it up, due to the evil eye.  One of the sons of his Rabbi (Who is also a Rabbi and the same age as my  bf), his wife commented to him in private to ask if we were expecting  and said congratulations, but he still did not tell anyone there even  though he said he was going to over Rosh Hashanah. We were there for  services all 3 days in a row, this past weekend. It's hurtful to me that  he still hasn't told them and he won't give me a reason. I said it is  us being unmarried? Because if that's the case, we BOTH made a choice to  be where we are now. Us being unmarried now, hasn't changed our plans  to be married in the future. I don't know how to feel because he just  won't answer. They also do not know that my mother isn't Jewish, but  people typically don't go around asking these questions. Chabad shuls  welcome anyone and don't ask for your ""Jew card"" (Nowhere does  obviously) so to speak. They see me as any other Jew when I come to  their shul.

I understand that in  order to be considered fully Jewish, I would have to go through the  conversion process and that's where I feel cheated and like no matter  what I do, I STILL won't be good enough, all because my father chose to  marry and have a child with a gentile woman. I obviously had no say in  that and feel like I may suffer for the rest of my life because of it. I  told my bf on the first date who I was and where I came from, and he  chose to stay. I had about an hour long conversation with the  conservative Rabbi about all of this and he said I'm more Jewish than  many other Jews that he knows. He did also tell me, and I was aware of  this, that if I convert within conservative, the Orthodox will still not  recognize me as Jewish. I cannot spend my entire life worried about  what others think, and I don't plan on being Orthodox. I told my bf this  on day one as well. I do not wish to cover my hair after marriage. We  are somewhat kosher, but not 100%. I light candles every Friday night. I  go to at least one, if not both, Shabbat services. I don't work or earn  money on Shabbat, but I do drive and use my phone. I try to keep a  chill environment and relax. I observe. I pray. I believe in one G-d,  the Torah/commandments, and kindness to your fellow man, and quite  frankly, I'm tired of people being judged on ""how"" Jewish they are. And  what's really crazy here, is that not ONCE in my life, has ANYONE ever  asked for my ""credentials"", so to speak. No one has asked me ""Is your  mother Jewish?"" ""How did you become Jewish?"" If people ask me questions  about my life, I tell them. I don't keep secrets. No one has ever  treated me differently when they knew my mother wasn't Jewish. That's  what's so weird about all of this. I had to get tested for Tey-Sachs  because of my ancestry, Israel accepts me as a citizen and I was  eligible to go on birthright (I didn't because of a childhood illness  and a few other things going on. I walked away from Judaism for much of  my early 20s). The list goes on.

Two  Rabbis (One Chabad, one conservative) both know my story and neither  have treated me differently. The one Chabad Rabbi (Also my age) still  invites me to events. He asked me what do I want for myself, what does  my bf want? My bf has never told me ""You need to convert or else""... And  obviously, converting is for YOU, not another person. I personally  never thought I'd have kids or find anyone that I felt comfortable  enough to have them with, so I never visited the subject of converting  because it didn't seem necessary. This all just happened so fast and  seemed like a dream. I always loved kids, just didn't think it would  happen for me. More than anything I feel grateful, blessed, and excited.  I can't wait to meet our son. We also have an Orthodox Rabbi/mohel who  is going to be doing the Bris and knows my story. It didn't change  anything and he's still going to do it and issue a certificate with our  son's Hebrew name. The conservative Rabbi that I mentioned earlier is  aware of this and said we are in good shape as of now, and not to worry  about anything at the moment and take it one day at at time. He said no  one has ever approached him about conversion and he doesn't have a  program set up, but will look in to starting one after the high  holidays. I'm trying not to worry, but this is hard. I don't even know  what my question is or what I'm trying to say, but I'm sure someone here  will understand. I cannot go through an Orthodox conversion just to be  accepted because one, I don't plan on living the full Orthodox lifestyle  and two, we don't live within walking distance of any of the shuls. You  can't exactly pick up and move overnight, and the cost of real estate  in our area has gotten bad. My bf eventually wants to move out of state.  I'm also afraid that I'll never be Jewish enough for him for us to get  married. We've talked about getting married at the courthouse because an  Orthodox Rabbi won't be able to marry us unless I go through that type  of conversion, which I don't plan to as I feel it wouldn't be genuine.  My Dad feels that I'm making myself crazy and need to relax. I just want  my relationship to remain strong. We want our son and any future kids  raised Jewish and I don't want to feel like I have some sort of dark  cloud following me all my life over something that's really a  technicality at the end of the day. It just sucks that so many with  Jewish mothers who don't care about Judaism at all, don't observe, are  not G-d fearing, are considered more of a Jew than someone like me, all  because it's from my father and not my mother. I have relatives that  didn't have Bar/Bat Mitzvahs for their kids and married someone in  another faith because it just isn't important to them. Any ""conversion""  process I go through, I simply don't see it as that, but it seems that  it's always going to be questioned and debated, based on what I've read  on here. I'll still be the same person. I consider it a learning  experience, not necessarily the experience of ""becoming"" Jewish because  that's what I know. I have never believed in any other faith. I think in  Judaism, you need to find your own way and can't be led around on a  leash by other people. It's YOUR journey.

Any help or advice is appreciated, and Shana Tova. :)"

One of the sons of his Rabbi (Who is also a Rabbi and the same age as my  bf), his wife commented to him in private to ask if we were expecting  and said congratulations, but he still did not tell anyone there even  though he said he was going to over Rosh Hashanah. We were there for  services all 3 days in a row, this past weekend. It's hurtful to me that  he still hasn't told them and he won't give me a reason. I said it is  us being unmarried? Because if that's the case, we BOTH made a choice to  be where we are now. Us being unmarried now, hasn't changed our plans  to be married in the future. I don't know how to feel because he just  won't answer. They also do not know that my mother isn't Jewish, but  people typically don't go around asking these questions. Chabad shuls  welcome anyone and don't ask for your ""Jew card"" (Nowhere does  obviously) so to speak. They see me as any other Jew when I come to  their shul.

I understand that in  order to be considered fully Jewish, I would have to go through the  conversion process and that's where I feel cheated and like no matter  what I do, I STILL won't be good enough, all because my father chose to  marry and have a child with a gentile woman. I obviously had no say in  that and feel like I may suffer for the rest of my life because of it. I  told my bf on the first date who I was and where I came from, and he  chose to stay. I had about an hour long conversation with the  conservative Rabbi about all of this and he said I'm more Jewish than  many other Jews that he knows. He did also tell me, and I was aware of  this, that if I convert within conservative, the Orthodox will still not  recognize me as Jewish. I cannot spend my entire life worried about  what others think, and I don't plan on being Orthodox. I told my bf this  on day one as well. I do not wish to cover my hair after marriage. We  are somewhat kosher, but not 100%. I light candles every Friday night. I  go to at least one, if not both, Shabbat services. I don't work or earn  money on Shabbat, but I do drive and use my phone. I try to keep a  chill environment and relax. I observe. I pray. I believe in one G-d,  the Torah/commandments, and kindness to your fellow man, and quite  frankly, I'm tired of people being judged on ""how"" Jewish they are. And  what's really crazy here, is that not ONCE in my life, has ANYONE ever  asked for my ""credentials"", so to speak. No one has asked me ""Is your  mother Jewish?"" ""How did you become Jewish?"" If people ask me questions  about my life, I tell them. I don't keep secrets. No one has ever  treated me differently when they knew my mother wasn't Jewish. That's  what's so weird about all of this. I had to get tested for Tey-Sachs  because of my ancestry, Israel accepts me as a citizen and I was  eligible to go on birthright (I didn't because of a childhood illness  and a few other things going on. I walked away from Judaism for much of  my early 20s). The list goes on.

Two  Rabbis (One Chabad, one conservative) both know my story and neither  have treated me differently. The one Chabad Rabbi (Also my age) still  invites me to events. He asked me what do I want for myself, what does  my bf want? My bf has never told me ""You need to convert or else""... And  obviously, converting is for YOU, not another person. I personally  never thought I'd have kids or find anyone that I felt comfortable  enough to have them with, so I never visited the subject of converting  because it didn't seem necessary. This all just happened so fast and  seemed like a dream. I always loved kids, just didn't think it would  happen for me. More than anything I feel grateful, blessed, and excited.  I can't wait to meet our son. We also have an Orthodox Rabbi/mohel who  is going to be doing the Bris and knows my story. It didn't change  anything and he's still going to do it and issue a certificate with our  son's Hebrew name. The conservative Rabbi that I mentioned earlier is  aware of this and said we are in good shape as of now, and not to worry  about anything at the moment and take it one day at at time. He said no  one has ever approached him about conversion and he doesn't have a  program set up, but will look in to starting one after the high  holidays. I'm trying not to worry, but this is hard. I don't even know  what my question is or what I'm trying to say, but I'm sure someone here  will understand. I cannot go through an Orthodox conversion just to be  accepted because one, I don't plan on living the full Orthodox lifestyle  and two, we don't live within walking distance of any of the shuls. You  can't exactly pick up and move overnight, and the cost of real estate  in our area has gotten bad. My bf eventually wants to move out of state.  I'm also afraid that I'll never be Jewish enough for him for us to get  married. We've talked about getting married at the courthouse because an  Orthodox Rabbi won't be able to marry us unless I go through that type  of conversion, which I don't plan to as I feel it wouldn't be genuine.  My Dad feels that I'm making myself crazy and need to relax. I just want  my relationship to remain strong. We want our son and any future kids  raised Jewish and I don't want to feel like I have some sort of dark  cloud following me all my life over something that's really a  technicality at the end of the day. It just sucks that so many with  Jewish mothers who don't care about Judaism at all, don't observe, are  not G-d fearing, are considered more of a Jew than someone like me, all  because it's from my father and not my mother. I have relatives that  didn't have Bar/Bat Mitzvahs for their kids and married someone in  another faith because it just isn't important to them. Any ""conversion""  process I go through, I simply don't see it as that, but it seems that  it's always going to be questioned and debated, based on what I've read  on here. I'll still be the same person. I consider it a learning  experience, not necessarily the experience of ""becoming"" Jewish because  that's what I know. I have never believed in any other faith. I think in  Judaism, you need to find your own way and can't be led around on a  leash by other people. It's YOUR journey.

Any help or advice is appreciated, and Shana Tova. :)"

I am curious as to a question I have regarding the Satmar world. The Satmar ideology is that Zionism is against G-d and a huge factor in why the Shoah happened. In fact Yoel Teitelbaum wrote a whole treatise on the world view. 

But I find that this ideology may have limits, outside what is taught in say a Yeshiva in Brooklyn or Kiryas Joel. Satmar rebbes and Hasidim interact quite often with Chabad Lubavitcher emissaries, rabbis and community members. Why would they willingly interact with a movement that has become for all intents and purposes Zionist? For example a Satmar Rebbe even goes to a Chabad house in the Coachella valley when he is on holiday to daven. Isn’t that showing a permissive attitude of acceptance to the Zionist world? For example, there are Litvak/Yeshivish groups that still maintain a cherem against Chabad.

Curious as your opinions."

1,2023-09-19,The Disappearing Twice-A-Year-Jew,u/The-Zal-Podcast,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16n1rla/the_disappearing_twiceayearjew/,"With the COVID lockdown all but over, synagogues are assessing the damages it wreaked. To me, the most important of these is the drastic decrease in Jews that attend services only for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, also known as Twice-A-Year-Jews. 

Official studies are yet to bear this out, but you can ask your local Shuls, Synagogues and Temples. 

There are a number of potential causes, each likely played a role:

• The realization that life went on just fine without High Holiday services (or, in less traditional denominations, Zoom was enough). 

• The breakage of routine. 

• The speeding-up of, what would’ve been a more gradual, phasing-out of an older generation. 

Of course, many of the Jews not attending High Holiday services simply aren’t engaging whatsoever. 

But even within involved-Jews themselves,  High Holiday attendance seems to be at an all-time low. 

While no one would claim that this development, in and of itself, is a good thing from a Jewish-community standpoint, it does point to other characteristics of the current Jewish psyche which I would argue are healthy. 

Jews are finding ways to engage beyond the annual rote attendance at what can be misunderstood as morose functions. 

• The explosion of Jewish practice in the day-to-day (not just twice a year) allows for a more real value system. 

• The accessibility of Jewish wisdom and knowledge via the internet (beyond liturgy) deepens appreciation and equips for real-world challenges. 

• The increase in celebrating of other Jewish holidays allows for more joyous entryways into practice. I have no statistics for this either - but any Rabbi from between 1970 and 2010 would be shocked about how well-known and well-kept holidays such as, Simchat Torah, Lag B’omer and Shavuot currently are. 

Perhaps joyous, meaningful and regular practice is likelier to inspire the once-a-year-seven-hour-foreign-language-marathon than vice-versa."

I think that you guys, from your culture to your language to tour laws, are just really really cool. I’ve been reading about different antisemetic dogwhistles so I can know who to avoid.

It’s odd now going around my high school and seeing just how many people make “jokes” about Jews or the Holocaust. My school is very progressive with a lot of queer/disabled/POC, so it seems odd that they would make so many antisemitic comments towards an ethnoreligious group. 

For example, a kid at my school always calls his Jewish girlfriend a “gold-grabber” and makes fun of her to her face. She doesn’t even seem to care, and makes fun of other Jewish people as well. I’ve heard kids joking about their “ideas to solve the Jewish problem”.

I honestly just… don’t understand. Why do people hate you so much? Whats the POINT? I’ve even asked them, why do you hate Jewish people? And the response is almost always a scoff, or a “why wouldn’t I?”, or some batshit statement about money or censorship or the “elite”.

I (37M) recently had a difficult conversation with my old man about my Jewishness, and it's made me want to re-evaluate my choices.

As background, I come from a lapsed Presbyterian mother, and a Reform father. I was never Bar Mitzvah'd, and I never went to Hebrew school (though my younger siblings who are also both from blended marriages did attend Hebrew school). I'm what you'd call *Jew-ish*, in that I identify today ethnically as a Jew, but not spiritually whatsoever. I celebrated holy days with family as a child, teen and young adult, but can count on one hand the number of times I attended shule. *I just never felt that connected to Judaism*.

In the last few years, I transitioned from something of an atheist back to a spiritual place, but my go-to has been Christianity and Unitarian Universalism. For some reason, Judaism as a religion just seems off the table for me - I don't feel a strong draw there. It's come up recently with my father (who has really embraced his Jewish ess in the last 10+) that I've learned away from Reform Judaism and towards non-Jewish spritual paths. 

My Dad's understandably upset that I've never really embraced or at least explored my Jewishness. Though I stand by my previous choice to follow whatever religious path I want, I find myself second-guessing the last few years. 

Has anyone else had this experience? Where they're Jewish ethnically, but don't really feel connected to it spiritually? Or where they've never considered themselves Jewish, but that found spiritual inspiration in their Judaism later in life? 

Just looking to talk about it and get some insight, I guess."

This coming Monday the 25th I'll be attending my first synagogue service (yes, I'm born Jewish, just never attended a synagogue) and am wondering what to wear. I am attending a Yom Kippur service through my university's Jewish chapter at the local synagogue which claims to be unaffiliated (not orthodox, conservative, reform, etc.) and it supports all levels of observation. I don't want to dress overly formal so should I wear a full suit, business casual (dress pants, tucked dress shirt), or what should I wear? I could possibly reach out to the organization and ask but I want a general idea of what clothes to bring from home first. Also, do I need to bring my own kippah? Thank you everyone. "

Which letters do they start with?

Meaning - I am aware of the book style, block style, and script style. 

Do they learn them at the same time or is it more of like the way Americans do when you learn cursive in 3rd grade (although I don’t think they are teaching English cursive anymore). 

I recently purchased a few workbooks and working my way through them, but I wanted to get a better understanding of how this is done in general with kids that are learning in a school setting. 

I personally enjoy handwriting and decided that if I’m going to learn to read Hebrew I might as well learn to write it too."

This is an honest question, purposed to elicit explanation, not provoke argument.

What will happen to the Palestinians in the West Bank/Judea and Samaria?  They lack full statehood, and they remain under effective Israeli control.

For those on the Israeli right, is this situation they expect to continue indefinitely? Are they committed to repressing every intifada, forever? What happens a generation from now? When the settlements have presumably grown, but the number of Palestinians has grown too? (Please understand, I am trying to be objective here). 

I have family from the Rhodesia and South Africa, and I always wonder of those white minorities : what were they thinking? How did they ever think this could work long term? And yet they marched their peoples into the political consequences of their demographic disadvantage. 

Are their Jewish Israelis who despair of how the demographics seem to threaten Jewish Israel?

1,2023-09-20,Specific question regarding Orthodox conversion in Israel,u/galaktischehexe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/16nhnu5/specific_question_regarding_orthodox_conversion/,"Hi all,

Around 3 years ago I started to go through the process of converting Reform back in America. I decided to make aliyah and because of my Reform conversion, I knew that at some point I should do an Orthodox conversion for the sake of my future children in Israel as well as my desire to be married and buried through the rabbinate. I have been living in Israel for a year now, kosher and shabbat observant.

Of course I have been dating but knowing that is frowned up for Orthodox conversions, I met someone who I genuinely believe is the person I want to be with. He and I are very much on the same page about wanting to be able to married through the rabbinate. I knew before I met him it was something I would do and I told him that it was something I would do with or without him.

Because of this, I am worried that a rabbi would prefer we not be together for the process. Are there any exceptions for couples who are engaged? Or is this a hard-no because of the views on pre-marital sex? My boyfriend is halachically Jewish and completely non-observant. It's safe to say even as a Reform convert, I'm still wildly more religious than him.

I also met a woman once who was Jewish but not halachically, had gotten engaged, found out she wasn't Jewish halachically and converted again to get married to her husband.

I am genuinely curious about this because I don't want to end this relationship but I also want to be Orthodox.

Any words of kindness are appreciated.

Thank you!S"

I’m a Patrilineal undergoing (and 3 months away from going to the Beit Din) Orthodox giyur, and my community has been nothing but welcoming and encouraging. Frankly I’m treated better than when I used to attend my Uncle’s conservative shul (and was about the undergo conversion). 

Everyone has different lived experiences and mine are anecdotal, but for the Orthodox Judaism isn’t some card carrying “special member club”. Sure any group of people have bad eggs who will discriminate no matter what, but ultimately halacha is halacha. If you have the status via conversion (to O standards) most Orthodox Jews wouldn’t even say anything because of lishon hara, even if many deep down think of you as different. Ultimately it’s a burden to fulfill all the commands, and pretending as if the movements are the same to undermine and deride Orthodoxy isn’t helping anyone.

If one doesn’t want to keep or can’t (such as LGBT) keep all of the Mitzvoth, then I understand not undergoing O conversion. One shouldn’t get angry however that O Jews wouldn’t consider that person Jewish. Frankly they view liberal Judaism as a metaphysical problem for all halachic Jews in those movements anyway, if the question is self-identity, why give said people that power? They’d never accept you as equal as a halachic Jew either, unless you kept all the major commands like shabbos and kashrus.

Now calling someone out publically or even privately (other than to prevent halachic issues like davening in a minyan) for their status is certainly wrong and vulgar. There is no excuse for treating fellow humans with disrespect. 

I simply want people to be intellectually honest (most of the people posting lately to complain are just looking to put down Orthodoxy). It’s like discrimination by skin color in the military 50 years ago. No one was going to stop the remarks, but the legal threshold of equality was set, and many remarkable servicemen went on to achieve greatness. If you want to have halachic status then the onus is on oneself to convert not on an entire movement to change itself to accommodate you."

Do you recite it line by line as if aloud? Read the English? Atone for sin or offer miscellaneous prayers? Meditate and reflect in the presence of G*d?

Personally, I’ll usually go through the prayer somewhat quickly, reciting lines that stand out to me, let my mind meditate for a bit, and then offer a personal prayer of some sort."

Some of you may remember me or my previous posts, I'm an undergrad student who is studying antisemitism and its effect on the Jewish community. Last spring I was looking for participants to interview about this research. I'm happy to share that I was invited to participate in a grad-level course to continue my research this semester! That being said, for this class, I have created a small 5-question survey to expand on some themes that were picked up in my previous interviews and to see how common they are. Please feel free to participate, and I hope everyone is having a sweet new year.

I have my bachelor's in computer science and have some experience being a software engineer but was wondering specifically if anyone could give me some advice about how I should look for work. Is something like sending my resume out to a whole bunch of postings on linkedin my best bet for now? Also is anyone here in the audio/video field? I know it's very broad but I have a lot of experience doing audio engineering, working with video installations, and professional photography. Would love to know if that's a field anyone in this sub has experience with in Israel because its either corporate gigs or freelance stuff for me in the states so far.

I fast on Yom Kippur and don't use electricity, but for various reasons I don't attend shule at the moment. I also will be alone most of the day, which makes it super hard to just...sit there and not eat or drink.

In previous years I've read several books on YK, including Catch 67, Noa Tishby's book and a few others. 

I've just ordered Shimon Peres's book, which I'm hoping will be my book this year. However, I'd really like some more suggestions!

I'm specifically interested in:

- Jewish history (all periods)

- Histories of each Jewish community

- Israeli history/politics

- Zionism

- Biographies of famous Jews

I can read multiple languages but since it's short notice I think I'll have to stick to English because of delivery times before YK.

Thanks in advance, and hatima tova to all!"

I've only ever attended Orthodox synagogues and services and know mostly Orthodox people. A question occurred to me the other day that isn't at all important but I am very curious. 

For people who attend congregations that play instruments during Shabbat and holiday services: did you blow the shofar on Saturday, the first day of Rosh Hashana this year? In Orthodox synagogues we did not because it's considered an instrument, and not allowed on Shabbat. But for those of you that *do* play instruments on Shabbat, does the shofar count as an instrument that can be used? 

Thanks!! I thought of this question and have literally no one to ask who would know so turning to y'all instead!"

I’m reform so I don’t have any first-hand knowledge but I assume all Ashkenazi yeshivas in the US use the same pronunciations.

It got me wondering about yeshivot in Israel, do the students use the same Hebrew accent there they would use in everyday life, or is there one accent at home/in public, and a different Ashkenazi one used in their studies?"

I grew up in northern New Jersey. My Temple had a robust Purim carnival every year and it was a huge event. One of the things that we had of course were hamantaschen. My favorite were the prune, but we also had apricot, raspberry and mun. but here’s the thing they were donuts. They were triangular, fluffy, delicious, filled donuts covered on the outside with sticky honey or sugar. It’s all I ever had until I was in college. When I saw the cookies that my friends were making/buying/eating I thought oh how cute they made hamantaschen into a cookie. That’s when people started looking at me like I was insane. The last time I saw the donut hamantaschen was approximately 1977. every one I’ve seen since then has been a cookie. 

Is there anyone, one single soul, may be around my age, maybe in Jersey, anyone at all who has had the donut hamantaschen? Is it even possible that I dreamed the whole thing? I’ve asked a couple of people that I grew up with, and they usually say they don’t remember it’s possible but they can’t say for sure.

We never used it but my understanding that it was important to have for a variety of reasons, including ""just in case"" scenarios like antisemitism.

Because of family memory about about our parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents having to flee from antisemitism.

I was recently talking to someone non-Jewish and my guesstimate was that maybe more than half, but perhaps not two thirds, of American Jews consider having a passport to be important ""just in case"" it is every important to get out of the United States.

I also estimated that probably around one tenth to one fifth of American Jews either have or are planning to get dual citizenship (not necessarily with Israel) and consider it important to have due to concerns about the future, i.e. safety issues around being Jewish in the United States.

Do you have any experience with this feeling? Is my family kind of unusual? How common is this for American Jews?

I did some Googling but could not find a lot of results.

I did find that a little more than 40,000 American Jews did Aliyah in the last decade. There also seem to be a few hundred thousand people who already have dual citizenship. That would put the number at far less than one tenth to one fifth of American Jews, more or less. However, a lot of people I talk to seem to mention it casually."

Hello, fellow Redditors,

I'm on a quest to find the perfect yeshiva in Israel, and I could really use your guidance. Let me delve into the specifics of what I'm seeking, including my hobbies and interests, and perhaps you can help me discover the ideal destination.

**My Background**:
- I've dedicated time to understanding the Chumash and can read Hebrew at a middle schooler's level (though translation is not my strong suit).
- I don't align with any particular Jewish sect; I'd describe myself as more spiritually inclined than strictly religious.
- The freedom to explore my thoughts and integrate secular realism into my studies is paramount to me.

**My Goals**:
- My primary aim is to deepen my spiritual connection with Judaism before stepping into the world of adulthood and family life.
- In terms of denomination, I'm open to yeshivas of all stripes – Kiruv, Conservative, Reform, or Modern Orthodox – as long as they align with my specific criteria.

**Personal Factors**:
- My life journey has been multifaceted, marked by challenging experiences and a mix of odd jobs.
- I occasionally indulge in recreational activities like smoking weed during my free time.
- I'm hoping to find a yeshiva with a supportive community of kindred spirits who may have walked unconventional paths in life.

**Hobbies and Interests**:
I'm also passionate about various hobbies and interests, including web design, video games, cooking, forex trading, graphic arts, boxing, and sneakers.

So, here's where you come in: I'm reaching out to you, the Reddit community, for personalized recommendations. Where do you think I should go based on my unique needs, spiritual goals, and diverse interests? Have you come across any yeshivas that not only nurture spirituality but also cater to individuals with a wide range of hobbies?

Please share your insights, personal experiences, or any knowledge you may have about yeshivas that strike a balance between spirituality, open-mindedness, personal freedom, and perhaps even offer opportunities to explore my various hobbies. Your input will be instrumental in helping me embark on this transformative journey! 🕊️📚🎮🍳💹🎨🥊👟🙏🏼"

I am a diaspora Palestinian dealing with mental health challenges exacerbated by my longing for a connection to the region. I'm exploring the option of retiring/moving there after a while, or maybe being a seasonal resident or part-time resident in or near my family's village in the West Bank. How would I go on about that? Due to the Israeli occupation (or whatever you wanna call it) in the West Bank is the best I can hope for like a temporary travel visa issued by Israel? Is there any way to gain legal long term residency?
  

  
Thanks you. "

I run a small poultry farm and conduct the slaughter myself. I'm also a women. I'm also not Jewish. So my question is, could my birds be labeled kosher IF a Shochatim oversees the slaughter? or is that going to be a hard no due to being a non Jewish women? is the answer going to vary between Jewish community's?  I have a two fold reason for seeking the kosher label: 1. I believe it's a superior way to dispatch a bird vs how the USDA would like it done. 2. I don't see any other 'small' poultry farms in the area doing this. I'd even be willing to take 'classes' or such if the community requested it. Thanks in advance"

I was offered a job in Israel and they were very confused on whether they can hire me without a T.Z. I attempted to find clear written answers online so I could forward to the hiring management and I cannot not find them. 

I will make the phone calls to Misrad Hapnim as soon as possible after Yom Kipur, but in the meantime I'm curious what the thoughts are here.

1,2023-09-21,A Yom Kippur dilemma,u/WarningWitty6533,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/16olrv8/a_yom_kippur_dilemma/,"I am totally secular , a ""cultural"" Jew. I used to work for many years for a Jewish organization and had the day off on Yom Kippur. For me, not fasting or going to synagogue, but a day of relaxation with my kids, who attend Jewish education and therefore also have a day off. 

This year, an unintentional ""mishap"" happened: I work this year as a ""loan"" in a state institute and not only that I have forgotten to ask for a day off on YK , but I agreed to visit a professional course on that day. 
This absence, due to the course, has been approved and there is some documentation I have to bring back from the course. 

Now the dilemma: 
- when I realized my mistake I told the professional course that I *might* not be able to attend because of the holiday and they basically said okay, come and do a similar course in November (I am risking that there aren't any free places in the November course). 
- however, I feel it would be dishonest to just have a day off without notifying my workplace, which will legitimately ask how could I forget. And tomorrow is Friday, we're talking about Monday, so I might not be able to get anyone to inform them 
- and as mentioned before, I am not really religious. I would have spent the day with my kids

So, what should I do? 
- bite the bullet, go to the professional course and try not to screw up next year. The course is supposed to be important. 
- inform the workplace, and ""enjoy"" a day off (might even go to synagogue, since one of the kids expressed mild interest). I might have to face unpleasant ness in informing them so late. It's not great for me. 
- go to my workplace as the course doesn't expect me and that would be the honest thing to do
- go to neither. I don't think I will get caught, but it sounds dishonest to me . Besides, it sounds like something Homer Simpson would do. 

Please, I'd appreciate answers mostly from ""secular"" Jews, as obviously religious ones would be appalled by the mere idea of forgetting Yom Kippur..."

I'm looking to build a sukkah myself but it seems very unclear to me what materials are kosher and what aren't. The whole bamboo matt thing seems crazy. What did people traditionally use? Just tree branches? Is there really a concern about using a reed mat or fence? And how does anyone keep squirrels out in the united states? Does anyone in the northeast US really sleep in a sukkah?

1,2023-09-22,Mother Issues,u/Electronic_Orchid200,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/16owkkx/mother_issues/,"I (35M) have a pretty stereotypical Jewish mother. She is loving but very nosy, obsessive, and intrusive.  We have had a fairly enmeshed relationship throughout most of my life with free flowing information running both ways and lots of emotional support and leaning on one another. She has severe anxiety/OCD and possibly other disorder(s).

Once I met my wife though in my late 20s I started to make an effort to be more independent and now that we have a child I’m truly looking to focus primarily on MY family unit.

My wife is not Jewish and so is not really familiar with just how “involved” Jewish parents are and try to be in their lives. I respect that and I have expressed to my mother multiple times that I do not want her looking into things for me when I haven’t asked for help, do not want her pressuring and guilting me into doing things that she thinks I need or should do in order to alleviate her anxiety. I often just went with the flow in the past because I didn’t really care and it made life convenient for me to allow my mom to dictate things for me.

I try to tell my wife that a lot of the things she does is “cultural” which I do believe to a certain extent. But my wife just sees a lot of the things she does as rude and presumptuous. And to be perfectly honest, she is right.

Anyone ever dealt with a situation like this? Just looking for more independence but mother having a hard time dealing with that."

One of the Rabbis I’m connected with (orthodox) asked me about my love life. I have a bf of almost 9 months which in the orthodox world is way too long to wait for a proposal. He thinks I should try to push things along bc otherwise I’m just being strung along. He says I should ask my bf (who does say he sees a future w me) if he has a timeline for progressing our relationship i.e. does he plan to introduce me to his family and friends and when, to propose and when and what timeframe are we looking at. He says if my bf seems wishy washy or stalls, or if he wants to wait and see for x amount longer to suggest taking a break from each other or just be friends. He also called me out on not wanting to ask those questions bc the answer could hurt.

For some context I’m 40f and already have kids, but want a husband and maybe more kids. For more context my bf has said he’s apprehensive about being a stepdad and thinks his family wouldn’t approve of me because I already have kids, but that he loves me and wants a future with me. So those statements are driving the sentiment of get an answer from him and waste no more time.

By secular standards, nine months isn’t that much time for a relationship, but somewhere between one and three years a proposal should happen if its going there. I’ve already had three long-term relationships with men who said they wanted to marry me, but never took action to make it happen and eventually I left.

So, dating advice from a Rabbi? Yay or nay"

[https://www.foxnews.com/video/6337519179112](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6337519179112)

Have a watch of it. Well worth it. The interview is in English and the Prince gives a good account (even if it's his version) of himself.

The interesting thing is that on every question put to him, the Prince basically says one of two things:

* We're reforming
* I don't care, my GDP is growing

... except normalization with Israel -> where his comment is that he wants to help the Palestinians.

But everything else is about growing Saudi Arabia's economy.

Here's what I think. I think if you read between the lines -> he doesn't give a shit about the Jews and Palestinians, insofar as what they can do for Saudi Arabia's GDP. In this... fundamentally... Israel is far far more important.

His game is to extract as many concessions from the Americans for what Saudi wants and he's using the Palestinians (again, like all other Arabs have done) as a bargaining chip to extract more of these concessions. Since the Americans likely can't deliver what Saudi says they want (2SS, etc, rest of the Arab BS about RoR/compensation), the Americans will give him more to get him to drop demands he doesn't care about anyway.

I think the end game is a very favourable deal to Saudi, a favourable deal to Israel & USA and tokenistic window dressing made out to be ""the deal of the century"" to the Palestinians. I could be wrong, and I may have misread him - but that's what I saw."

I’m a nurse in a free clinic that provides services to underinsured and uninsured people   Recently an ultra-orthodox Jewish man and wife called asking for services, noting that the husband had to be seen by a male nurse and male provider and the wife be seen by female staff. Not a problem very easy to accommodate. 

However, we could not put any information into our record system. When asked his age (primarily to tailor the exam to the patient’s age group) he would only mention he was over the age of 18. When asked his name he only said Anon. And when attempting to make a bit of small talk “what brought you to the area?” His only response was “Different things”.  Otherwise he was very pleasant. 

Would love to know more because my colleagues are seeing his wife in a few weeks.

WHY?  He's staying with family friends who are hosting him and could even get a letter from Israeli cousins of ours vouching for his visit... but we don't understand how he should approach the Population/Immigration Passport office at the airport.

I have a really fun lesson plan for the kids 5-12, we're making buildings out of toothpicks and marshmallows (it's an engineering experiment, since the parents want more STEM that ties into Jewish ideas and Sukkot is about building) then we're doing candy sukkahs and learning about the lulav and etrog. 

But does anyone remember any good Sukkot activities for older teens? I was thinking I could turn the toothpicks and marshmallows building activity into a competition, but then I don't think a 15 year old would necessarily want to make a candy sukkah for an hour. Is there something really fun but a little more engaging/less juvenile? Feel free to share anything you remember from your own Jewish schools or synagogues!"

A little background: My husband and I recently joined a very welcoming, progressive, Conservative style synagogue. We’re interfaith- he was raised Jewish (his mom converted from Catholicism) and I am someone raised Catholic and always kind of just blowing in the breeze figuring out what feels right to me. We agreed to raise any children Jewish, and I was happy do so. It’s been a learning curve and he expects nothing special out of me, but I take off for high holidays and we attend services and events together as a family. We have a huge support system in our city of similar young families.

Now to the reason for the post: we plan on attending YK services Monday. I could drop our baby off at daycare that day and fully focus on the service, but then I would have to pump midway through services. That would be wildly inconvenient for so many reasons. So my thoughts would be to bring her to service’s anyway, and excuse myself to feed her. But this raises so many questions for me. She can get pretty vocal and for a solemn holiday I don’t know if it’s a good idea to bring a baby.

 Further, I don’t fast on YK for a few health reasons outside of breastfeeding. I need to find a space to duck out and have water and a snack while nursing especially, and to give my baby her snacks. I know I’m not displeasing any higher power by doing this, but I want to be sensitive to everyone else. I don’t care about a private area for nursing, but I do care about not chugging a ton of water in front of everyone and decorating the lobby with my kid’s yogurt melts.

I’m wondering if I should skip services altogether, but I’m already bummed I’ll miss Kol Nidrei and Yizkor because of bed time for the baby. 

What’s your gut reaction?"

This is not a post bashing converts at all.

My roommate and I were best friends for years, we met in college and lived together while in school and after. It's our third year living together, and right after we renewed our lease in May, my roommate stopped paying rent.

She didn't pay rent for June or July, and then in August ""accidentally"" spent my $900 in rent and we were facing eviction. She got a grant through her job that saved our asses. This has caused a huge tension between us because she owes me almost $2k now.

Her mom passed in June, and it put her in a bit of a financial strain as her mom had taken out loans/credit cards in her name. I would give my friend money for food and groceries, but it got to the point that I had nearly cleared my savings paying her rent and I couldn't give her any more money.

The first time I told her I couldn't give her money she lost it on me. She threatened to kill herself and I ended up giving her money because I was scared she'd do it. I've tried to get her to a hospital but she refuses. She's badmouthed me to all of our mutual friends and tells me it's my fault our friendship is over and I ruined it because I can't let things go. I tried to talk to her the other day and she told me I need to be on meds because she's never met anyone as stressed as me. She tells everyone I only care about money, when the reality is I've told her I don't care how long it takes her to pay me back; I just don't want to worry about paying the rent all on my own every month. My therapist thinks my roommate is emotionally abusive, and I'm starting to see why. There are times when I'm scared she'll hurt me and my cats- she slams doors and hits things to scare me when she's angry.

Now I've found out that she's converting through the same movement as me- and there's only one conservative shul in my town. I feel sick when I think about it, I hate being at home now because of the tension. My shul is like my second home at this point- because I hate being at my actual home. If she shows up I don't think I'd be comfortable there. If she wants to convert and feels like it's the right thing for her she should it, but I feel like this is more to get back at me than anything else.

I've thought about talking to my Rabbi- but I know he's busy with the holidays. There's a reform shul in town I can go to, but I very much prefer my conservative shul and I don't want to leave over this. I'm just torn up over this and I don't know what to do."

I recently learned that some observant Jews wait varying durations of time before consuming milk or meat before they are allowed to consume milk or meat again so if you ate a dairy product you have to wait a while before you consume a meat product.

Our stomach acid is mostly water and the temperature of our stomach never reaches anywhere near the boiling point of water. The food in our stomach is mostly broken down through enzymes, not heat. I am wondering if the act of digestion is considered a form of boiling under Jewish law."

Hello Reddit community,

After some insightful responses to my previous post, I've come to the conclusion that Aliyah is the next step for me. I'm 22 years old, not committed to serving in the army, and was a C student in high school. However, I have a range of work experiences in various backgrounds.

I'm now eager to continue my education in Israel and have some questions:

1. What are the selectivity levels like in international colleges in Israel? Can anyone recommend specific colleges that might be a good fit for someone with my background?

2. How should I go about finding accommodation when I first arrive? Any tips or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

I'm excited about this journey and would love to hear your insights and experiences. Thanks in advance for your help!

I have personally been though 15 Yom Kippurs since dealing with harm that I caused. I followed the Maimonides model for teshuvah- I owned my actions, I figured out how and why I strayed from my values, causing harm and I put in place all the necessary changes to behave in ways in which I could be proud. I worked to heal the relationships with people harmed. I asked for forgiveness. I demonstrated how I had changed.  I worked to help reduce other harms. And when confronted again with similar circumstances that led to me causing harm, I went down a totally different path —demonstrating that I had grown. 

Yet still, people who only know a very small piece of my story may choose to gossip.  I’ve learned that lashon hara is bad — even if the words being spread are true.    It amazes me when I see people in synagogue on Yom Kippur judging others and gossiping.    

Because of what I’ve been through, I think I have a deeper connection to the holiday.  It helped create a much better version.  Me 2.0.  Someone who has much better relationships with family, friends and coworkers.  I’m someone who gives back to my community in ways I never would have imagined. 

So I guess if you’re going through the effort of observing the rituals of the holiday, perhaps see if you can go even a little bit deeper this year.  See the people in your community who have done the work! 

I wish you an easy fast. G'mar chatima tova!"

This post is also two bits embarrassing, but I have to ask:

I'm currently living in Costa Rica. My support system is zero as both sides of my highly dysfunctional family shunned me for having depression and other mental / emotional maladies.

I'm an Israeli citizen who made aliyah when I was nineteen, lived in Israel for nearly seven years, not always in the best conditions, but got by, made honest work, had a roof over my head, and never went hungry. Never did the army either due to my conditions which were beyond my control.

I ended up receiving nichut from the Bituach Leumi after years of doing odd jobs all over the country and declining the assistance from the Misrad HaRevacha because I did not want handouts. So finally the folks there assisted me in getting nichut, and life improved.

Things were finally looking up, I was leaving the hostel I was living in Tel Aviv for years, when stupid me decided to return to Costa Rica.

Costa Rica is by no means a good place to live if one has a nonexistent support system. This country turned into a cesspool of corruption, crime, armed robberies, etc. It was once nice, but not anymore. The prices are first world prices in a third world country.

Many days I can't afford to properly eat and can't get constant access to the medications needed, or get proper medical assistance as the pay at my job way too low to afford it. Unemployment is at an all time high.

I also have hypertension and had near strokes several times as the treatment here, although it ""exists"", is highly deficient and one can now say that it's nearly nonexistent. Aldi, some folks here have to wait four years or so for a life saving operation and are buried six fit underground years before said operation.

I've also been living away from people for years with what many would call a ""functional"" depression, working from home taking calls for a call centre for a job that pays very little and does not cover the bills, and my health is deteriorating to the point of not working properly anymore. 

My health is quickly going to 💩 besides the hypertension, depression, etc. and I'm at the end of my rope. I do not trust the doctors here, as I had a case of malpractice (long story).

All this said, I have the following questions:

- Does the Israeli government assist citizens abroad in crisis to return to Israel even if they made aliyah many years ago?

- What can one do and who can one contact to get assistance before flying to Israel?

- Does the Misrad HaRevacha and Bituach Leumi assist in the cases of people in trouble stranded abroad, and how long will it take to receive said assistance? Is there a way to contact these folks to get a relatively quick answer?

- Will I owe them insurance money even if I've been barely surviving abroad for years with my health going to shit in the process? 

- What could be done once in Israel and how can one set up healthcare there? I had Clalit and silly me underestimated how excellent the doctors there are even if some are grumps. Here many allegedly buy their doctor certificates and one can end up a vegetable if handled by the wrong person. I'm not exaggerating.

- Does the government offer any monetary assistance to start living in Israel again if one is returning due to emergency circumstances, even if one made aliyah over twenty years ago?

Anyway, just need to know where to start so I can return ASAP, and any advice would be more than welcome. Please don't judge."

Best (seeming) combination of rate, speed, ease and  apparent safety, So I set up an account and gave all my relevant  information, e.g. name, address, bank account, etc. But when it asked  for the recipient's info, it only asked for her name, address and her  bank's IBAN code, but nothing about her actual bank account. Seemed kind  of strange to me.

Do I have to  press the ""Transfer Money"" button so it takes me to a page where it asks  for this info, or does it wire the money to her bank and the bank then  contacts her so she can pick up the money, or perhaps mails her a  physical check to her address? I don't want to risk clicking on the  button to find out that it's one of these options and won't wire the  money into her bank account."

The music is so amazing and links incredibly well to two other set works! I can't wait to analyse it. I also watched it and it's such incredibly good Jewish representation that the exam board would honestly be stupid to not include the film as a ""sorry for putting you and other Jewish kids through that"". 

I'm writing a letter to my music exam board about the inclusion of an questionably anti-semitic film (I'm Jewish and found several issues with it) and I would like to recommend that they replace it with a film sensitive to the Jewish experience. 

I don't have much experience in films and not a lot of time (due to my studies) and would like to ask you guys if you had any recommendations.

I was going to recommend *Schindler's list* (because of the music), but if I'm asking the exam board to be sensitive about the controversy surrounding one film, then perhaps [it wouldn't be wise to include *Schindler's List*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List#Reception) as a recommendation. 

The film doesn't have to be about the Shoah, it can be anything really that educates on Jewish experiences and is done well. I don't know if it would be better that it's not all about the Shoah (maybe give gentiles a better viewpoint that our lives, whilst affected by it, are not defined by it). 

I would prefer the composer to be Jewish as it would help highlight Jewish music. 

I am also mentioning that *The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas* is absolutely 100% not acceptable as a replacement film. 

I don't want to mention the film or its director as they might find my reddit account if they google it and I want to remain wholly professional. Also whether or not the film itself anti-semitic is up to opinion (but nevertheless it is rooted in anti-semitic stereotypes).

I think they'll listen to me as they've shown sensitivity in the past to how they represent non-white people in the past."

I have Sefaria, but I wasn't sure whether that was the best translation to use.

Edit: I've just found the Jewish English Bible Translations Wiki and it's so cool! Idk why I didn't just google it but I honestly didn't have the words to google it."
1,2023-09-23,Question Regarding Boycotting,u/soulvents23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/16q5tyw/question_regarding_boycotting/,"Hello all,

I just had a question regarding boycotting products. I live in America was wondering about discount department stores (Ross, Marshall’s, Bealls, etc.) that sell Puma products. I don’t buy the Puma products but I was wondering would they still kind of get money from just the products being in the store. I was reading about retail stores and saw that they buy from wholesalers and then sell them. Would that mean that the money they (the retail stores) make would go to the the wholesaler (which may be Puma in this case) and would it be best to boycott stores that sell Puma all together? I just wanted to make sure that I am properly boycotting them and other brands.

Thank you!"

I’m been aware of this issue between Israel and Palestine and have many talk on it. I am strongly against killing of the innocent. Therefore Israelis or Palestinians dying is not something thing anyone should want, I know some Israelis and Palestinians want that for each other.

In my eyes Israel is the big strong country and Palestine is the weak country with nothing going for it so logically Israel is the one causing more damage. But then I see Israelis mention Hamas and that Palestine is run by a terrorist organisation threatening their people’s safety which also makes sense. 

But to cut it short looking at the casualties and injuries alone, it’s clear as day one side is suffering a lot more than the other. Even if Israel is in the right the means doesn’t justify the end. At the end of the day it’s clear the Palestinian civilians are the victims. Seeing how safe Israel is in comparison as well makes the picture clearer. 

If I was Palestinian seeing people I know die I honestly would have the same strong hatred to all things associated to Israel, I’ve seen posts with Israelis saying “This is who they elect” with men shouting obscenities about killing all Jews etc, but can you blame innocent civilians suffering for feeling that way. In a time of weakness and desperation people lose sense and are easy to manipulate.    

I want to hear why you disagree if you do, I don’t see how such a strong country backed by the worlds biggest superpowers can excuse killing so many civilians in attacks intended for “terrorists”.

Thanks"

I wonder, is there collectively (as in, for the most part) a bad blood between Arabs and Jews?

Before anyone comments something negative, please read this and try to understand my perspective. I have tried to stay hopeful and positive. I have tried. 

I am a very spiritual person. I am not really religious anymore, but I do believe in God, I practice most of the holidays, I used to daven and, particularly, I read tehillim A LOT. For the past 7 years of my life, I have had MANY health issues enter my life. I know it is normal and a part of life, but the thing is, there are truly so many issues, one after the other that I am starting to lose my actual mind and questioning God. 

First, I experienced panic attacks that became panic disorder. I had the worst version of it. The kind where you could not do anything but lay in bed and pray for the pain to go away. I prayed every single day, for a few hours. One day I woke up and it was GONE. I was so lucky that I overcame it within 3 months, when usually my case takes YEARS. I do believe Hashem was there and answered my prayers. But then...

My *physical* health issues started with the virus in 2020. I had long term covid unfortunately, diagnosed by a doctor. It gave me very weird sensations in my legs, nerve pain, brain fog, etc... the pain I felt was the worst. 

Then, a year later, I fell on my back in the shower. It was so scary and shocking.  I started to experience terrible pain in my arms and legs. I could not move some days. I could not walk. I got an MRI done and discovered that I have two herniated discs, one in my neck and one in my lower back. But the neuro told me that the pain I described is not correlated to my herniated discs and there was another additional issue we need to find. 

He did a small ultrasound and said that he says I have a lot of muscle fixations (my fingers were involuntarily moving) - which means we need to do more tests to make sure it is nothing serious. He says some adults experience this from anxiety (which I have) but he needs to make sure it's nothing more.

The next is a little tmi but we are adults here.... I had shocking, SHARP pain... downstairs, and then a doctor did an ultrasound and discovered that I have multiple ovarian cysts. There has been a few other health issues that I don't think people will be comfortable reading so I won't mention it, but you understand my point. This has happened almost one after the other, for years now. I am so mentally exhausted and feel like a different person. 

Recently, I have very sharp pain under my upper left abdomen. When I breath in it hurts. When I touch it its tender and I then noticed it's a bit puffy and hard there. Swollen. 

From all of these things that have happened, I have seriously started to question what was happening. Was this all random? Is this my fault? Is God doing this to me? I have resulted, a lot of the time, to it being God who is punishing me. If this is a test, I am failing because I find myself becoming so angry, cursing, and questioning G-d. What is the point in this suffering? What did I do??? I wish I could get that answer. I feel so miserable and at times when I am 10/10 angry, I pray to God to allow me to die because I can't take this anymore.

I don't know if I am being punished for something by Hashem, but it feels that way. No one in my life me even believes me anymore. They can't fathom what I am going through because it's just too many stuff happening one after the other. With the most recent stuff, I have not even told anyone. 

This is the loneliness time in my whole life. I honestly feel like my purpose here is to suffer. This past pain I have been feeling- my first reaction was laughter instead of sadness. I just started laughing. Like, wow. really? this now, huh? ok!

I have seen a side of me I never knew existed, until I started feeling all different types of pain and health struggle. I have grown very negative, bitter, and hopeless- and I apologize to God on the daily for my anger, but then I curse at him again and question it all. 

I am scared for Yom kippur because every time I pray for good health and content around that time, it does not help because I just suffer more that whole year. What is even the point in praying this year? Clearly, God does not care at all. Or, this is part of my purpose and plan for who knows what. Why did he create me just to suffer? The last time I felt like myself was when I was like, 19 or 20. I am currently 25 years old. I feel like I lost so much of my youth and watch so many people around me happy, thriving, learning, dating, traveling. And me? doctor appointments. depression. praying. another health issue. 

I wish I could find a good rabbi or something like that, who can help me. who can give me an answer. who can tell me what I am doing wrong. 

**Does the torah or anything else within our religion talk about why this happens to people?** Is there something I am doing wrong? I mean, I am a young women who minds her own business. I want to be a therapist and I am currently in school for it in NY. I am very empathetic, I have this deep desire to help everyone around me, I wanr a simple life really... but that dark side? I get angry fast, and deeply, and I have depression and a lot of people in my family are the same way. 

I am starting to lose hope once and for all, and want to die. I literally pray to G-d to end my misery. I don't want to actually die, but... I miss the girl I was before. The one who did not know pain, not like that anyways. With every health issue, I have been quite hopeful and positive, but the past year that has all gone away. I feel anger all the time. I feel so miserable. I don't know what to do anymore. I just assume worse things will be happening this next year as well. "

I lived in a very Jewish community, I was always taught being Jewish is special and to be very careful around goys. I attended chabad and synagogue regularly, I went to Hebrew school and we did Shabbat regularly, and we ate strictly kosher.

I lived in Israel between ages 8-10 and there my family told me we weren’t orthodox bc the orthodox there were so far from how we practiced. But then we came back to the US, my parents divorced, and my mom stopped practicing. At my dads, we couldn’t afford dinner every night so we went to chabad a lot for services and had the free meals there, generally I felt very welcomed. I’m also autistic and while it was hard not to move or fidget, it was comforting in a way. I attended a public school and when I found another Jewish kid to be friends with I got really excited, but she got frustrated with me a lot because she said I was too orthodox and it made things hard. I said I wasn’t orthodox bc they’re way more strict, she said I’m orthodox by assimilated standards. So in my head there were Jews, assimilated Jews, and goys. 

In the next couple years I learned what Christianity was and when they told stories about the Bible in sexist ways and with different pronunciation, I thought I was taught wrong and felt really confused. I asked my dad and he said we attend orthodox temples, but not ultraorthodox, but when I asked my mom she just said it didn’t matter to her. So in short, I’m confused, am I orthodox or not? If anyone can offer insight I’d appreciate it."

So I am Jewish and my family immigrated to the US from Israel. They are still Zionist however I am very much not. When people ask me what I “am” or where my family is “from” I’m not really sure what to say. I am supposedly technically Arab as my origins are from Syria but I don’t feel it’s right to say Syrian. I also don’t feel right saying I’m Palestinian because that isn’t true but if I say Israel I’m afraid people will assume I’m proud of that or a Zionist. 

So my question is, would it be inappropriate to say my family is from Palestine since I believe Israel should be Palestine or would that be disrespectful to Palestinians? Not really sure how to describe my identity in a truthful way that isn’t politically incorrect or insulting to Palestinians."

When I was in highschool we started going very often and I could never really connect

In college I went to a buddhist temple for a long time and even worked fairly closely with the leader there for again more volunteer work

Now due to having religious friends I volunteer at their churches quite a bit. (I grew up being taught how important volunteering is and that is kind of my favorite part about any religions I have been around) 

But... each time ever since I was a kid that something with Judaism pops up it makes my ears raise and hearing about how the Jewish community is actively searching for more knowledge and isn't afraid to question and have complex ideas really inspires me.

I want to talk to a rabbi and maybe just ask questions about beliefs but I don't know how to go about it. 

I haven't found a religion that I've connected with in the way my soul wants and I've done a lot of searching. The Jewish faith really interests me in a way that it keeps coming back. It's like an itch that I can't scratch but in a good way. 

What's a good way to reach out? will a rabbi be okay with me just asking basic questions and being curious?

1,2023-09-24,Need help with conversion direction,u/kurt_46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16qogww/need_help_with_conversion_direction/,"I have been in the process for converting for about 11 months. For the first couple of months, I was converting reform and I decided I wanted to be more observant. For the last 6 months, I have been converting under an independent conservadox rabbi. I love converting with him and we share many of the same approaches to observance. 

But, I feel like my conversion has been thus far lackluster. Our current structure is we meet 2-3 times a month to go over readings and have long discussions about a myriad of things. While these meetings are intellectually very fulfilling, I have done very little “action.” When I ask about what I need to actually do in my house + life to prepare for and practice being a conservative observant jew, the usual response is either “what do you mean?” or “we’ll get there eventually.” 

I don’t know any of the blessings, I haven’t done anything with kashrut, I’ve only lit shabbat candles once, and I haven’t been to any traditional shabbat services. Looking at my somewhat-local conservative shul’s website, their Jews by Choice page has a detailed timeline of what a convert should be doing at each month of the process and I haven’t done a single one of them, even after being a (lower case c) conservative convert for 6 months and converting for 11 in total. 

Is this normal? Should I be asking for more? Should I try and speak with the conservative shul that I don’t 100% align with?"

I know that’s kind of like the point, but to me, GUILT appears in all capital letters. 

Not to alarm anyone, but…I feel like I really might be written in the Book of Death this year. Like, it just might be my time.

I want to reconnect and my dad is more observant, my mom got remarried to a catholic and celebrates his holidays and doesn’t participate in Jewish culture anymore. My dad stuck to Judaism, and I think for him it was a coping mechanism. Dealing with the divorce, soon followed by the loss of a close family member, and growing up pretty poor, I think it offered him a sense of structure through it all. As such, we attended chabad when we couldn’t afford food and I would join community gatherings for help in school because we couldn’t afford a tutor. I’m also autistic, I find it’s easy to unmask in Jewish communities and I find comfort in the structure it provides for day to day life, but my mom always made me feel like it’s a bad thing and I should hide my Judaism. So I rarely participated in Yom Kippur and when I did I was a lot younger and now I don’t remember most of how it goes.

If anyone could explain some of the things we’re supposed to reflect on, pray about, etc, I’d really appreciate it. Also because I’m autistic, saying in general “reflect” doesn’t mean a whole lot since it feels too vague, it might work for some I just struggle with that."

As I understand it, if your mother is Jewish, so are you. I've also heard it phrased as ""if you come from a Jewish womb, you have a Jewish soul"".

My question(s) about this is:
Which is the more accurate way to say this, and what are the implications/borders of this concept?
Examples:

If you were born to a non-jewish woman, who later converts, do you become retroactively Jewish?

I know Judaism is fairly accepting of trans folk, how do they fit into this? (Side question that just occurred to me: If a Jewish person transitions after their bar/bat mitzvah, do they need to do a second ceremony?)

I don't want to give out much information about myself, but I own a candy business and need help with categorising my food. I make vegan chamoy gummies. 

As I am a Muslim it is in our religion that basically all vegan food is Halal. I assumed that for my Jewish friends it would be the same as there is no meat or alcohol, just sugar and spices cooked together. But I've also seen that only food prepared by Jews or with 'kosher supervision' counts as kosher.

Google only tells me the relationship between meat and dairy, or other 'main' parts of the diet but I'd like to know from jewish people in depth what I can and cannot do. I have specific equipment for my candy so there's no cross contamination but I want to be certain that I can advertise my candy as Kosher for those who need it, and that I don't offend Jewish beliefs.

No religious arguments in the comments please, just need some advice on my candy :) thanks"

I approach Yom Kippur as being about personal and collective accountability, and I know that the fast is not the sole purpose of the holiday. Still, it’s been a while since I haven’t fasted. For whatever reason, I wasn’t expecting to be told this and was pretty thrown off .

I wanted to pop a quick question hence I'm considering a holiday to Israel in the summer of 2024. I absolutely love travelling, especially when I can combine it with history, and that's why Israel is high on my bucketlist.
Now, last year (summer of 2022) I visited a friend in Lebanon, for which I got a visa on arrival stamp in my passport. I know the situation between Lebanon and Israel isn't exactly friendly, and online I read quite a lot about how difficult it is to enter Israel with a stamp from an Arab country. But I didn't really find any rules about it, so that leaves me with the question;
How hard will it be to travel to Israel?
FYI; I'm from The Netherlands, almost kinda Scandinavian looking. Never visited another place with my passport. And I'm looking to join an group travel.
Really hope I can get some clear answers for you, and ofcourse before I book the trip, I'll also talk about this with the travel agency.
Thanks already!:)"

1- he was as close as a brother would be. But I know there are rules about what relatives you follow certain rules for. Do I mourn him as a brother? Or as a distant relative? What are the rules?

2- his parents are like my own. We were raised together. I want to pray for them too. They’re of course devastated. What prayer can I say for them? Does the prayer for the sick during Amidah apply? 

3- I make minyan about once or twice a week, but I put on tefillin in my own home almost every day. Can I say the mourners Kaddish alone or must I only do so in a minyan? 

I’m sure I’ll have more questions but those are the only ones coming to me in the moment. Thank you,

1,2023-09-24,How and why do you keep kosher as a reform jew?,u/veryaveragejew,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16r1udy/how_and_why_do_you_keep_kosher_as_a_reform_jew/,"I'm interested in observing kashrut this year. I grew up Reform and I'm very observant but most Reform Jews I know don't keep kosher. I'm wondering how and why people have chosen to incorporate kashrut into their faith despite it not really being a norm among Reform Jews.

I intend to try different things over the course of the year and see what feels right for me. I live alone and while I don't have the space for a full kosher kitchen, I absolutely have the means to cook kosher. I'm in nyc so i have abundant access to kosher-certified butchers and groceries, although I don't know if that will be a priority for me. My biggest challenge is eating out. I'm a huge foodie and I go out to eat all the time. I'm torn: I feel like if I'm observing kashrut at restaurants I'll be missing a piece of one of my greatest pleasures, but at the same time it might be even more spiritually compelling to have to exercise such restraint and thoughtfulness around indulgence. Ultimately, at the end of the year if I don't feel like I've gained anything from the practice, I won't do it anymore, but I'm interested in expanding my Judaism into more aspects of my daily life. It's also something I've always been a little afraid of, so it will possibly be the biggest spiritual challenge to me yet.

What personal dietary rules or limitations do you have for yourself, given that Reform doesn't really emphasize this practice? Do you do kosher-style? Full kosher? Only kosher at home? And why do you do it the way you do? How do you find it challenging? What do you feel like you gain from it? Feel free of course to chime in if you are not Reform :) "

I came in at roughly the same time as a brand new (to this community) rabbi, who has a 4 year old and has really been embracing having younger kids in the sanctuary during the service. Especially given that there doesn’t seem to be much dedicated child care- there’s an area in another room with toys, but not much supervision other than the kids’ parents- I think it’s lovely to welcome in Jews of all ages. 

The conflict I’m coming up against is that many of these children tend towards the disruptive. It’s not egregious behavior- they’re just being kids, I wouldn’t dream of yelling at them or complaining to the parents or anything like that. I think it’s important for the kids to feel safe and supported in shul. But some of their parents seem to do 0 work/redirection/soothing/teaching about when it’s necessary to be quieter- think kids babbling/laughing/playing with louder toys during the Amidah. 

I have this weird mix of a knee jerk reaction that this shouldn’t be happening, and a genuine feeling that Judaism needn’t always be quiet and solemn, and that if we want to keep it accessible for young parents and appealing for their children, standards of “propriety” must be flexed. (Shul is trad egalitarian, for an idea of the level of observance, but I’ve found it to be quite socially progressive.)

I’d be so happy to hear people’s thoughts on this."

# Would you invite a Roman Officer (who claimed to be Jewish) to Seder? and if so, Why?

&#x200B;

Would you invite a Roman Officer (claims to be jewish) to Seder? Knowing he makes it his daily ritual to oppress Jews of lesser means, enslave the less fortunate and undermine cultures, religions and peoples. Enslaves people (often times older CHILDREN) and puts them into uniform, separates them from their family, doesn't let them leave their servitude so they can use them as bodies using human wave tactics? Believes he is superior to all those who are not of his station and should be enslaved as such. But yet you invite him to SEDER?"

I would like to try and restore them for her, but I don’t know where to start... How are these pomegranates generally made, I assume they are dipped in some kind of paint/dye? If I had to describe the coating as it was peeling off, I would compare the texture to cellophane.

I'm just wondering how other kids might treat them if they aren't fully Jewish?

Backstory:
Fiance is Jewish on his mom's side of the family. I think one of his mom's parents converted, but I can't remember if it was his Zaide or Bubbe. 

I was raised Protestant, but haven't gone to church since attending college. I like the family & community values that are taught in both religions and enjoy going to Synagogue and celebrating holidays with his family. His family keeps kosher, but he  doesn't. 

I respect that some Jewish communities prefer to recognize bloodlines and also recognize that there is a range of reform to orthodox Synagogues. I've thought about converting but also feel like I wouldn't be wanted by some communities or that even if I did my kids would somehow be at a disadvantage in the Jewish community and I wouldn't want that for them."

I grew up in a home with mental abuse and every Yom Kippur was “If you don’t shape up by nightfall, you’re going to die this year.” 

We are expected to better ourselves but for people in abusive relationships, that betterment is unattainable since it’s measured by our abuser (through their reactions). 

We think to ourselves:

“I’m sorry I’m not good enough.”

“God (insert abuser name) is mad at me even though I’m trying my best.”

“I’ll try to make you like me more this year and become more to your vision.”


I hate it and I’m actually really bitter about this holiday. This year I’m just saying no fucking way anymore. 


So this year, in just not doing any of it. 

Does anyone else feel this way?

Note: I’m not against the holiday. If you don’t feel the way I do, that’s amazing."

I'm tired of ""praying,"" I'm tired of Shabbat and holidays. I'm tired of them interrupting my life and taking away the little free time I have. I'm tired of the inane routines. I'm tired of the songs. I feel like I have no life outside of this. 

This morning I said I'd come to shul ""later"" but it's 1:45 pm and I do not want to go stand until my legs hurt mumbling things I don't believe in. I feel so bad about feeling this way but I don't know how to snap out of this. 

I hate that there's still more holidays coming up. More wasted days in shul. More cooking for and cleaning up after a bunch of people for every meal. More sitting around all day making small talk with house guests. I don't get how I used to enjoy the groundhog day experience of doing this every single week. 

I am so, so sick of it. I'll probably delete this post later but I just have to say this somewhere and I can't tell anyone in my life."

From this it is apparent that excessive eating does not have the legal status of an act of eating.”

i found this very interesting - if we think of fasting and binging as both sides of the “disordered eating habit” coin, and as yevamot 40a states, having a different legal status than “regular eating”, could the obligations of yom kippur be fulfilled by exclusively binge eating (ie, eating until its painful, as an affliction, etc) instead of fasting? very curious what other people think!"

Yes, I know it doesn't work like that because we're an ethnoreligious group. I know that I can't just decide to leave, that there's literally no mechanism to do it. And that's part of the problem. 

We are an ethnoreligious group, therefore in some sense, every cultural tradition we have is a religious one. However, I am not a believer and never have been. Until now I have mindlessly followed along with observing the holidays, but never kept kosher or Shabbat. 

I live in Israel, and as you all are probably well aware, tensions between the secular and religious sectors are at an all-time high here. As these tensions rise, I come to resent more and more the power that religion has over me due to me being Jewish: People who are disconnected from my way of life tell me whom I can and cannot mary, where and when I can and cannot go on public transit and what I can or cannot eat, and also have the audacity to ask me to sustain their lifestyle with my taxpayer money.

This begs the question: if I don't believe in any of it yet simply being born Jewish puts me under the religion's power, why even be Jewish? What makes me part of this ethnoreligious group if I don't believe in the religion, and it's representatives make me feel unwelcome in the Ethnos because of it? 

Has anyone else here grappled with these questions? I'd be interested to hear your conclusions"

Even though I grew up Jewish, I became an atheist a while back. I like the sense of meaning that Judaism provides to one's life but the lack of evidence in *my* mind makes me not want to believe. I am also hesitant to follow traditions because it just feels dishonest. But I do know that atheists are still Jewish, and I'm trying to find a way to have a scientific, rationalist worldview while still enjoying Judaism, its rich culture, and the community values. I want to find meaning without sacrificing scientific thinking. I came up with a model for myself and I want to see what you guys think of it:




I'd like to follow the aspects of Judaism that add to my life. For example, eating fried foods on Hanukkah (because fried foods taste good), viewing myself as having a connection to Israel, but not because of the claims of the Torah, but because of archeological evidence of the kingdoms that existed in the region, using Yiddish slang because it's a fascinating part of my culture, and spending time with family during the Holidays.

I don't want to do things that restrict my life, like restricting the foods I can eat based on laws from a God I don't believe in, making myself submissive to a higher power, and not being able to do work on Shabbat.



I don't know where to go from here. I don't feel that the religious aspect of Judaism is for me since I do not believe, but I love the community that comes from Judaism and I am fond of the culture. But if I follow the culture it doesn't feel genuine. It would be like lying. What should I do?"

1,2023-09-26,"How do I tell my Rabbi on campus that I want to ""quit"" my conversion process and stop coming to the community?",u/ThrowableAcc7617,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16sbije/how_do_i_tell_my_rabbi_on_campus_that_i_want_to/,"Using a throwaway account for this.

Hi, I am a student at a large university in the United States. I converted to Conservative Judaism when I was 12 with my mother. Since then, I have become interested in Orthodoxy and have been interested in receiving an Orthodox conversion for many years now. I have been attending Orthodox synagogues since my interest began those years ago.

Last year I told my Chabad rabbi on campus about my situation and he was very understanding. I then started attending an Orthodox shul near where I live back in the city I live in. I also came in contact with some people who worked with the Beit Din in my area on conversions.

Things looked good, until they didn't. I soon began to realize the weight of my decision to pursue an Orthodox conversion in college. I essentially told my Chabad rabbi about my decision because I was about to take a class he was teaching at the Chabad center on campus and wanted to be upfront with him. Again, he was very understanding, but for me personally I began to feel how awkward it feels being a part of the community here and not really being Jewish, or seen as such. There is a lot of really uncomfortable situations, almost every single time I go to an event at Chabad, where in the course of some conversation I end up having to explain my incredibly awkward and ""unique"" situation. Let me be clear: the overwhelming majority of the people I see at Chabad are accepting and don't really care, this part of my issue is just that, a part of it, and incredibly personal and isolating. Furthermore because I am not really Jewish in the eyes of the community I am trying to be a part of, I personally feel uncomfortable telling people I work with in clubs or in school about my religious affiliation and especially telling them how that affects some of the things I can and can't do (like being unable to come to events on Friday nights and the day of Saturday, or the same for holiday observances, being unable to eat certain foods, etc.). Saying ""oh I can't do xyz because I am Jewish"" feels like a lie but saying ""I can't do xyz because I am converting to Judaism, something totally rare especially in a college community like this"" would for really awkward. Just a little bit more awkward in fact than doing what I usually do which is trying to get out of these situations by deflecting from questions about why I can't do these things or hiding my religious observances in some other way. It feels like I am half-in, half-out with the Jewish community and now half-in, half-out with my general community in college.

All of this says nothing about the practical difficulties with observant Jewish life in my college. There is only one Kosher dining area in the entire town my college is in. Furthermore, you can not own any kind of kitchen appliance that would help you cook Kosher food on your own in your dorms. Finally, almost all of the friends you make here will default to planning things on Friday nights, so you feel left out. You can't really go to events the school's clubs (as in student organizations not nightclubs) host if they land on Friday nights or during the day on Saturdays or Holidays.

But okay, all of that is really difficult for me but I have dealt with worse things in life. And in regards to those practical difficulties, that's just the burden you have to carry along with the (very) few other observant Jews on campus. I get it. Maybe I can get over these things.

But now the Rabbi on my campus has me do Shabbat-breaking tasks for him. He asks me to bring his kids in the stroller (because he and his wife can't carry things on Shabbat) to the Chabad on Saturdays now. I get asked to turn lights off or turn on the sink disposal. And on Yom Kippur, I was asked to turn off and on the AC and adjust it front of everybody during davening. This is incredibly embarrassing, as now people I see every week who I haven't gotten the chance to personally talk about my situation, see me ""breaking"" Shabbat without any context. So it's even more uncomfortable situations. But it's not even about others' reactions, it's the fact that I am basically constantly reminded of how different I am from every one else there. And I know I am different, but it really really sucks always being reminded of it. What's crazy is that the Rabbi didn't use to ask me to do these things and used to just find some other non-Jews to do these tasks or work around. I don't believe the Rabbi means anything bad by any of this. He is a really good person and positive figure in the community. I just really disdain this dynamic. I don't feel comfortable saying no to doing these tasks because a) the Rabbi said he can help me with the conversion process and b) I don't exactly know how my relationship with the him and the community will be if one day I am like ""no I don't want to do that anymore."" Like I don't know if he will be mad because maybe he thinks I am not observant enough so I shouldn't have a problem doing these things. I just don't know. And it is really isolating and embarrassing. I even went all the way back home for Rosh Hashanah in large part to not deal with it.

I know some of you may think this is way over-dramatic. I accept that. Outside looking-in, I completely understand that. But not even being officially ""registered"" with the Beit Din and going through all of this is really taking its very isolating, anxiety-producing, and depressing toll.

After a while of thinking about this, I've decided that I just want to quit. I want to stop being half-in and half-out and focus on school. I'll do what I now think I should have done, which is just wait to convert until after college. But I do not know how to tell the people I have gotten to know and the Rabbi that I want to stop coming. Or if I even should do that in the first place. I know this is not an easy question, but how can I tell him that I want to stop coming and put a ""pause"" on my conversion process? Alternatively, if you don't think I should quit, what should I do instead and why? Any advice or help is appreciated."
1,2023-09-26,Married to an atheist but my religious feeling is growing over time,u/packers906,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16sbuca/married_to_an_atheist_but_my_religious_feeling_is/,"My wife and I are both Jewish by birth but she grew up in a non religious family - I would even say anti religious.  I grew up somewhat religious and conservative but began questioning it as I got older and drifted away from it in college.   I never renounced it per se but felt I couldn’t find meaning in it anymore. 

Fast forward, I’m in my 40s and we have two kids.  Over the last ten years I’ve found myself very gradually being pulled back toward religion. First I had this awful feeling like I’d abandoned part of who I am, eg when I wouldn’t even observe the most important holy days like Yom Kippur.   So I went back to that.  Then it was other little practices and holidays - not eating pork and shellfish, having a very basic quick take Seder for the kids.  My wife was actually somewhat accommodating if a little grudging at times.  She is ok with us lighting candles for Shabbat and observing major holidays, she wants our kids to have a Jewish identity as part of who they are, they have attended some Jewish camps etc.  

I keep finding myself wanting a bit more though.  I have started praying in the morning.  I observe some  kashrut.  I cut off work email Friday sundown.  I feel like it makes me feel so much more grounded and content to have a feeling of the presence of God in my life, even if I believe in God in a somewhat abstract way.  What’s more, when I have occasionally brought my kids to services, they actually like it.  They take the prayer book out and read along and follow.  I feel like it calms them down too.  

All of this is good except my wife is not exactly a part of it.  I feel sad that it’s always just me and the kids if we go to synagogue.  We aren’t members of a specific one and have hopped around, so I don’t think anyone notices or cares, but if we became more fully a part of a specific synagogue community it might become apparent that my wife wants nothing to do with it.  It also means we aren’t participating in the community in other ways, like hosting people for holiday dinners and the like.  I guess I just grew up with that and took it for granted and now it feels a bit empty without it.   Also I’m pretty much on my own when it comes to stuff like figuring out how to plan for bar/bar mitzvah. 

I can’t really fault my wife. - it’s not what she signed up for when she married me, although sometimes I wonder if she might feel more at ease in life if she had had the chance to know that religious faith can be a comfort and a bulwark against empty consumerist life.  

Anyone have any advice?  I increasingly just try to lead by example so to speak.  When I started I was very timid and a bit embarrassed about reintroducing Jewish practices. Now I am much more confident in them and my kids take notice.  They were adorably supportive of my fast this year for example and made it through an entire afternoon and neilah service.  

I can’t be the first Jewish guy in a marriage like this."

My mom has enabled some of his bad behavior. She’s never set boundaries with him or acknowledged his bad temper and unkind attitude. She was cold to me and offered me no moral support when I said something for the first time to her earlier this month about what happened with my brother. We haven’t talked since. Unsurprisingly, I got no acknowledgment from my mom at Yom Kippur for her behavior towards me this last year. I wasn’t really expecting her to, but I thought there was a chance she might reach out. She’s notoriously unaware.

Israel is one of the only ""western"" countries in the world with a positive fertility rate, which is great, but as we near 10 million people, I can't help but feel like it's getting a bit crowded here. Add to that a forecast of a 20% population increase by 2040 and things get even more cramped. On top of that, the expected growth is coming primarily (but not exclusively) from populations that participate much less in the economy. 

With no growth slowdown in sight, what do you see as the solution to the population boom? Are small towns going to become major cities? Will Judea and Samaria become fully accepted as Israel proper out of necessity? Will housing and transportation be able to keep up with demand? So much to discuss!"

Today for Yom Kippur, obviously there were a lot of readings. All the people that were reading knew beforehand that they would be called up to do so. Some people were very experienced and of course stumbled over a word or a trope a little bit and that is to be expected but then a couple of people could barely get through it. I realize that this is not a performance, however as a professional musician, I can't imagine getting material beforehand, and then not practicing it before I get up in front of people. I'm really not talking about the people that were trying their best I am more just curious if there are some people that find out they are going to read and then just wing it or what? Our community holds the space for people who are trying and I understand that for some it can be very vulnerable to be up there and powerful at the same time. Again those are not the people I'm talking about but more the people that seem to just kind of hope for the best, but really should have at least practiced at home a little bit."

Shout out to the one guy who asked if I had my bar mitzvah already, my dad found it hilarious. I was super self conscious and feeling delirious from fasting probably didn’t help, but nobody really noticed me and I really didn’t stand out. My dad was so supportive, and my sister was too although we kept making jokes that I was “abandoning her” when she went to the women’s side. Also there were other trans people there and one nonbinary person I recognized who stood in the back without the barrier. Plus listening to the rabbi speak really resonated, like my rabbi is always really well spoken but it just really helped me figure out how I felt as a trans Jew.

It honestly was an amazing experience for me and I’ve honestly never felt more connected to my Judaism. For awhile we had to stop going to Chabad for reasons I won’t get into and it just happened to be during the early stages of transition, but I had the courage to ask my family if we could find a way to start going again and they agreed. It felt like before I tried so hard to wrap my head around things that didn’t resonate with me as a Jew and I felt so disconnected from my culture, now that’s gone. Like I cannot express how much this meant to me. Oh, and shoutout to everyone yesterday telling me I look like a good Jewish boy, and thanks for offering support and advice."

1,2023-09-26,About choosing Shabbat,u/mlle_lectrice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/16sigvk/about_choosing_shabbat/,"Hello everyone! 

So I've been studying the traditions, the holy days and everything. I haven't started my conversion yet because I want to be fully committed to it, and right now my work/study/money life doesn't allow me to do that this year, or at least not until the end of 2024. 

I have started to read about everything because I want to know better. And right now my big doubt is how to choose Shabbat. 

&#x200B;

I intend to convert to liberal Judaism, I live in Paris and work here. On Fridays I usually work from home, but not always, so I have to go to work at 9 o'clock and I'm home by 7 o'clock and I have to take the metro or a bike. And I started thinking, oh la la, how am I going to do this? 

I know that we can choose Shabbat in different ways, and as I tend to choose liberal Judaism, I know that it can be very flexible. 

&#x200B;

So I would like to know from new converts and liberal Jews, how do you all make Shabbat? What are your choices? Do you go out anyway or do you choose to stay in? Is it wrong to go out? What is completely forbidden even for liberal Jews? 

&#x200B;

Thank you all! If I said something wrong, I apologise and ask for patience, I'm still learning this beautiful path :)"

The fasting was hard. Being true to myself, I will admit I had to drink some water in the afternoon and munch on something as my body was starting to feel so awful I could have puked.

Aside for that. I attended the evening of Sunday and the evening of Monday (couldn't do the morning for a medical visit). 
Midway Monday's service (began at 4 pm finished at 9 pm) I started losing grasp of time and the prayers were just resonating in my head as I followed the procession in all of its parts. The hunger and thirst were hitting hard, and I was feeling extremely weak. 
The last hour of service I was in a sort of trance and I could barely follow the prayer book. Mind you, I can't read Hebrew just yet, so I was following abstractly the Italian translation on the side. 

But the experience was enlightening. It has made me consider many things, my faith above all since I grew up in a Jewish but almost anti-religious household, and I'm feeling obligated to learn Hebrew, or at least to read it. I want to start praying. 

I feel like I've missed an entire side of Judaism that could have shaped my personality while growing up. And I'd like to fix that.

> Eva Borgwardt, political director of the anti-Occupation group IfNotNow, says the group was “particularly heartened” by the results, noting that younger respondents had even higher levels of agreement: 38% of respondents under 40 [agreed](https://www.jewishelectorateinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/JEI-Survey-Analysis-071321.pdf) that Israel was an apartheid state (though, it should be noted, only about a third of the 400 respondents were under 40, making the sample very small). “The reality \[in Israel/Palestine\] has been called apartheid by Palestinian intellectuals, activists, and also human rights organizations, matching the international legal definition,” she added. “And it's inspiring that young Jews are increasingly seeing that for what it is.” With that said, Borgwardt added, “American Jewish public opinion should not be the arbiter of whether an international legal framework is an accurate description for something.” 

It seems like the rift between American Jews and Israelis just keep growing rapidly with each passing year. Do you think this might improve somehow or will we see a point in the very near future where most American Jews don't care about and even oppose Israel?"

1,2023-09-26,Penn Conference Admits the Truth About What Palestine Wants,u/TracingBullets,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/16srfyb/penn_conference_admits_the_truth_about_what/,"The Palestinian ""cultural"" conference at Penn took place over the weekend, and one of the topics revealed quite a bit about Palestine. [One of the conference topics was the following:](https://palestinewrites.org/p-events/the-right-of-return-and-how-to-achieve-it/)

> The Right of Return and How to Achieve it

> One of the most important lessons we have learned from 75 years of exile is that the essence of the struggle has not changed: It is the expulsion of the people of Palestine from their homes and the confiscation of their land. The implementation of the Palestinian inalienable rights is the key to a permanent peace. **All else, including a Palestinian state**, so-called regional cooperation or other contrived devices to obscure this fundamental issue, **is peripheral.**

This description proves what I and many other critics of Palestine have been saying for decades, because it's obviously true.

Palestinians/the Palestinian ""cause"" doesn't want what their online apologists say. They don't want freedom. They don't want sovereignty. They don't want equality or even necessarily human rights.They CERTAINLY don't want to ""just be left alone"" or no longer occupied. They don't want self-determination or statehood or anything else. They don't even care about international law or an end to people dying. They'll take those things, surely, on the way to getting what they want, but those things are not what their primary goal is.

They want one thing and one alone: the so-called ""right of return."" A made up demand unique to them and them alone based entirely on an excessively creative interpretation of one non-binding UN General Assembly resolution from over 70 years ago. 

So let's just all be honest with each other: Palestinians are killing Jews and will continue to kill Jews until the Israeli government allows millions of them free entry into the state of Israel, at which point it's a distinct possibility they will resume killing Jews. That's the situation, that's the reality, so everything else, the occupation, the settlements, the settler attacks, the 'apartheid', is all, in the words of Palestinian activists themselves, 'peripheral.'

The Palestinian cause isn't about freedom or sovereignty. It's about property, it's about clay, it's about dirt, it's about inanimate objects. Isn't human life is more important?"
1,2023-09-26,Moving provinces and will need to switch denominations!,u/OneBadJoke,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16sriw7/moving_provinces_and_will_need_to_switch/,"I’ve been planning to move provinces (Ontario to Nova Scotia) for a few years now and finally am set to move in December! I’ll be sad to leave my shul behind, of course, but that’s not my biggest problem. 

Nova Scotia has a very small Jewish population. There’s four shuls in the whole province!  Two Conservative (only one easily drivable from my new place), one Modern Orthodox, and one Chabad. As a nonbinary lesbian, obviously I’m going to the Conservative shul. Chabad and MO are not an option for me. 

I was raised in a Conservative shul but literally never went back after my Bat Mitzvah. It wasn’t until I faced a horrible personal tragedy as an adult that I started to go to synagogue again a little over two years ago. I found a Reconstructionist shul, and since then have fallen in love with my Judaism. 

I have no issue with Conservative and it’s my second choice behind Reconstructionism. But I’m really nervous about leaving my current community to join a new one. I don’t know anyone where I’m moving and I’ll be going alone. 

I’m afraid that my observance won’t fit the same as theirs. I’m afraid that an Autistic gay nonbinary person is going to stick out more there than I do at my quirky little shul. I’m afraid that I won’t like it, and will have to switch to Zoom services at my current shul. I really enjoy going to synagogue on Shabbat and am ready to drive the hour it will take me to get there every weekend! I’m just so worried that it’s not going to be a good fit for me. 

Does anyone have tips about switching denominations? Or about joining a new synagogue? Even tips about reaching out to the new shul or telling my current shul that I’m moving would be welcome! I’m still in my 20’s so I assume they’ll be happy to have someone young join, but I’m still nervous!"

1,2023-09-26,How to reclaim Sukkot?,u/porgch0ps,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/16sryed/how_to_reclaim_sukkot/,"Hi all!  

For a reader’s digest version, (and TW for sexual abuse), my father was sexually abusive for the majority of my childhood. I grew up in a patrilineal home and we celebrated major holidays, which included Sukkot. For many years, I would be abused in the sukkah. It has been my least favorite holiday for a long time. (FTR, I am in therapy and have been for many years). 

As I get older, I’ve been trying more and more to get closer to my Judaism (including a conversion) as it understandably had a long and complicated roadmap with me.  My question is what are some recommendations for how to make Sukkot mine?  I live in an apartment and I have a patio, not a balcony (and they’re very particular about what is allowed on your patio). I live alone and not near family as well. I’m just looking for ways that I may be able to make Sukkot mine. 

Thank you!"

Isn't it strange how this city of evildoers decides on the spot to repent?

In my head, just before Yonah arrives there is a story doing the rounds. Fresh news has come to Nineveh about a boat that was almost sunk because a man had gone against the Jewish G-d. The storm subsided immediately after they threw him overboard; lots of eye witnesses. 

Then Yonah arrives with the prophecy and they're all scared witless. His own actions caused what he dreaded to come true!

........

OK. Was about to send this and thought to check sefaria. This is actually an opinion brought by Abarbanel. I'm very happy right now."

If I look at the news sources that I usually rely on (mainly Guardian, NYT, BBC and Economist), it's mostly smaller things and I'm dropped in the middle of everything, lacking almost any background knowledge on the situation. Plus, it seems that most content is either screaming bloody murder to Israel or completely discrediting the situation in Palestine and only talking about the latest tecnological achievement accomplished by Israel. 
Additionally, it seems to me, at least from an outside perspective, to be one of the most complex, if not the most complex, conflict currently in the public eye, due to all the political/religious/regional/cultural/ethnic facets and the foreign meddling since and before the start of the conflict, which is why I'm looking for something more in depth. Idk if I'm making it more complicated than it is, that's just how it looks to me in my current understanding.

So what I'm asking for is any recommendations for good analyses/history of the conflict or surrounding the conflict (e.g. about the geographical region of Palestine) it can be books, videos, podcasts, anything is welcome, as well as where to get relevant, fairly reliable news on both sides.
Any perspective or combination of perspectives on the resources is welcome. Thanks in advance."

It’s not because of Yizkor (though that usually makes me cry, too), because this happened even when I left the service during Yizkor, when my parents were both still alive.

I don’t LIKE this, because I grew up in a family where crying was usually met with offers to give you something to cry about. I find it really embarrassing if anyone sees me crying, so I try to hide it.

Well I’ve been seeing protests and whenever I tried to find out about judicial reform all they were saying is “end of democracy” and “right wing takeover” and “bibi is this or gvir that”

So I did the research and seems judicial reform is a good thing. 

The reasonableness standard isn’t really reasonable

Court is basically self selecting which doesn’t say much for having other opinions heard

Court seems to have so much power that they can strike down laws at random with no real chance for appeal so if you don’t happen to be on the political side of the court you will never get a chance at having it your way and since the court is self selecting there is never a chance for difference of opinion or a power check to the court.

Ahed's aunt Ahlam perpetrated a suicide bombing of the Sbarro restaurant, her mother has praised a murder of an israeli child and the father has been accused of promoting terrorist attacks (from what I remember he said some things that praised martyrism, or could be interpreted as such). 

The Tamimi family has also been accused of using their children to provoke reactions from IDF soldiers for use as propaganda by some zionists.

I think that terrorism is never justified, and some members have indeed done and said things that are completely unacceptable (to say the least). I want to hear a Palestinian perspective on Ahed and the Tamimi family; Should the entire family be condemned for their history? Are they doing more harm than good and why do some Palestinians view suicide bombings as resistance?"

My grandfather was Jewish, but adopted into a Christian family (not that they were overly religious, his adoption didn’t have anything to do with his culture or anything of the sort). I’ve watched a YouTube video of a Jewish creator (illymation) talking about her identity, and she states that within Orthodox Judaism you only become Jewish if you mother is, but my grandfather wasn’t Orthodox. He wasn’t taught about his culture, resulting in neither my dad or aunts being taught about theirs, but I don’t think it mattered to them. Naturally, I wasn’t taught about it either, I didn’t even know my grandfather was Jewish until 2-3 years ago (when I was 11 or 12). I showed my father a little bit of Illy’s video and when Judaism comes up in conversation we (Dad, brother, me) classified ourselves as “a little” or “kind of” Jewish but my dad has mentioned that we can’t really “stand for it” when I joked about getting a Menorah. My grandfather unfortunately passed before I was born so I can’t talk to him about Judaism. I don’t plan on becoming religiously Jewish, as I’m already a happy and proud Asatruar. Although, my culture and where I come from is extremely important to me. I’ve also heard that you can’t be “half Jewish” cause that’s not the way Judaism works, like it’s the same way as in maōri culture. Either you are, or you aren’t. My brother did some light reading and came to the conclusion that in most cases we wouldn’t be thought of as Jewish, but I want to talk to more people about it and do more of my own research. I just want to know if I could classify myself as Jewish, and if researching Jewish culture and taking part in it would be “correct” for me to do. I’m just wondering if anyone would like to give me some advice, or something along those lines. I prefer talking to people about it instead of googling, it feels more real and I find it easier to understand if it comes directly from a person to another. 

Side note: I’m not trying to “reach” or force Jewish culture onto me if I’m not Jewish, for me it’s just really important to know my culture and heritage.

1,2023-09-26,Supporting Palestinian Justice: Overcoming Obstacles and Seeking Guidance,u/chendengue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/16t41yl/supporting_palestinian_justice_overcoming/,"Greetings,

Allow me to begin with a quote by renowned scholar Edward Said, who once stated, ""The Palestinian struggle is not just a political conflict, but a battle for justice and human rights."" It is in the spirit of this profound truth that I write to you today.

For years, I have been an advocate for the Palestinian struggle, using logic, facts, and reason to shed light on the injustices faced by this community. Sadly, my efforts have not gone unnoticed, as I've encountered slander, ridicule, and even bans from various social media platforms. As Noam Chomsky has aptly noted, ""The mere mention of Palestinian rights often triggers unfounded accusations of anti-Semitism.""

It is disheartening to witness these tactics aimed at diverting attention from the real issues at hand. I have engaged in conversations with individuals in person who, like scholar Ilan Pappé has observed, find it futile to discuss these matters online due to the censorship and deletion of posts. To them, it's akin to ""talking to a wall.""

However, my belief remains steadfast that even if my words reach just one person and help them understand the grave injustices perpetuated by Israeli authorities, then I have fulfilled my duty. Nonetheless, I've recently noticed an increase in shadowbanning, which further restricts the reach of my posts.

This brings me to my inquiry: Is there a reputable organization where individuals like me can donate money to support the Palestinian people? I am aware that numerous organizations exist, but regrettably, some are marred by corruption. As scholar Rashid Khalidi once emphasized, ""It is crucial to ensure that our support reaches those in need without compromise.""

Your guidance on trustworthy organizations or any other means to support the Palestinian cause would be greatly appreciated. Together, we can continue to work towards justice, peace, and a brighter future for the Palestinian people."

I can't do anything bad anymore even little things like not paying at the gym . I feel so humbled .  I guess as a single guy porn and jacking off is normal but now it just feels wrong. I can't even watch porn it is gross. I don't have a girlfriend and I'm not talking to any girls sexually anymore. I don't know what to do. Should I just go monk mode and not jack off anymore I guess and this is the new normal? This was the first shabbos (yom kippur is technically shabbos) I kept completely / flawlessly without sinning at all (One year I turned a light on and off but this time I left it on).  I'm a Baal Teshuva so this is totally new and outside of my comfort zone. For religious single guys how do yall deal with this? Seriously lol   


I understand that probably most orthodox religious people just wait until they get married to have sex. But do the men just never masturbate?  When I was secular I felt like guys jacking off was what they all do but just didn't talk about. I mean even monkeys jack off. I guess humans should have better morals than monkeys. I do feel like I have more soul energy when I don't masturbate and I feel more innocent.  I just have a really high drive and I don't know what to do. How do yall live like this lol ..

1,2023-09-27,Feeling doubt,u/VenomRingo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16t5fpe/feeling_doubt/,"Where to start - I did not grow up religious *at all.* Besides a vague idea of my Jewishness, I did not interact with Judaism in the slightest until college. It was there where I discovered how special Judaism was through my first shabbat with Chabad. I really loved the singing, schmoozing, and feeling of community - it felt like a home away from home. More than that actually, it felt like home itself. Through college, I made being involved in my Jewish identity my top priority. I sought Jewish community and learning opportunities through my Chabad and Hillel. I flirted with higher observance in college but I did not feel ready, internally, to take on 'kabbalat ol ha-mitzvot.' I certainly learned a lot about Judaism in college and felt extremely confident in calling myself a Jew but I did not interact with the belief system until very recently. I enjoyed doing the rituals, saying bracha in Hebrew, and just doing the religion! Since graduating college last year, I moved to a new city where I am working for a Jewish organization. Since moving, I decided to explore orthodox communities and practice. I've since joined a progressive modern orthodox shul and attend a lot of events associated with other modern orthodox young adult organizations. However, during this time, I really began to confront the belief system of Judaism for the first time, and how unknowledgeable I was compared to other people who can give a spontaneous shiur on any random topic in Judaism. Rather than shying away, I was deeply attracted to the intellectual stimulation that our faith provides us and I decided to jump in. I started keeping kosher then a few months later I went to study at a trad egal yeshiva over the summer. During that experience, I was able to try shomer shabbos and I fell in love with it there. Every Friday night and Saturday was full of everything I loved: community, food, singing! When I came home from the program, I told myself that I was going to keep doing it. There are days where I love and days where I suffer from incredible loneliness because my social environment is not shomer shabbos, and they make me feel crazy for doing it. I'm now writing this after Yom Kippur services where I was at shul all day which is something I've never done before. It was a painful experience but I did get a lot out of it - mainly learning about my yetzer hara that was trying to rationalize getting a bacon cheeseburger after the fast (I did not do that lol). I do believe in G-d and I do believe in the Torah. I want to believe in G-d and I want to believe in the Torah. I want to always feel the intellectual attraction and emotional security of Judaism. I am just feeling doubt. That doubt gets resolved by reading intellectually honest books and talking with observant people who are doctors, lawyers, scientists, and, generally, very intelligent people! My doubt flares when I come across people that I respect who are so adamantly anti-religion (which they are entitled to), especially Jews who proudly don't participate in our tradition. It makes me feel sad because I find such beauty in celebrating our holy days (from the cultural to the very religious parts!) They make me feel that my whole life is just confirmation bias and what I want to believe in - what I do believe in - is just a sham. There's a beauty in the Orthodox, albeit modern, way of life that I want to be apart of. I don't want to be as sensitive to other people's opinions but it is really hard. I want to have intelligent and beautiful responses to people that ask me why I believe.  Is this all just going to burn out? People ask me if I'm a baal teshuva all the time and I used to say no - because of the connotations - but now I proudly say yes even if I have doubt because I want to overcome it. Sorry for the ramble - I'm just feeling defeated and dumb."

One is the interim Rabbi of the congregation I definitely want to be part of - I spent the high holidays with them and it feels like a great fit. That said, I feel a bit less connected to the Rabbi compared to the congregation. The other Rabbi I connect a lot with as a person/teacher, but I don't intend to join his congregation.

This means that Israelis can now travel to the US for short durations, up to 90 days, without a visa. Instead, they will be required to fill out an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) form. The electronic systems to facilitate this are expected to be ready by November 30.

  


Proponents of Israel's inclusion in the VWP view it as a significant step forward in strengthening bilateral ties between the US and Israel. Supporters emphasize the program's role as a security partnership that also promotes commerce, travel, and cultural ties between the two nations.

  


Critics argue that Israel's admission into the VWP does not fully consider the challenges faced by Palestinian-Americans and Americans of Arab and Muslim backgrounds when traveling to Israel. They point to the rigorous restrictions and checks that these groups undergo, which Israel justifies as anti-terrorism measures. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) has filed a lawsuit against the move, highlighting issues like the difficulty for Palestinian-Americans to drive in Israel and other travel restrictions they face especially Gazan-Americans. Some claim that the changes Israel has made in response to these concerns still do not match the reciprocity standards of other VWP countries.

Now I would like to have my family members remembered by having their names inscribed into the list of the Righteous Among the Nations. We do have some proof, but I feel like Yad Vashem might need a bit more. I am hoping to find a descendant of one of the Jewish women. I have the surname of one of the women and she has been listed as a Shoah survivor. But how can I find the rest of her family? Is there a list of survivors \*along\* with their descendants? Or maybe there is a special Israeli Facebook I have not heard about yet, or some organisation that keeps track of such things? I know that this is a long shot, but on the other hand, the Shoah has been documented quite well. Unfortunately for me, the woman in question married into a family with a relatively popular surname that belongs to, what seems to be, a well-known politician, so I am not sure how fruitful looking through Facebook might be. We do not have information about the other little girl, all we know is that she migrated to the States after the war. Thanks!"

1,2023-09-27,Do you support banning brit milah?,u/mirkwoodgdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/16tnkup/do_you_support_banning_brit_milah/,"It became abundantly and sadly clear that many people on this sub are supportive of the protests against the worshippers in Dizengoff square. 

The reason given is that ""we're not against public prayer, we're against enforced gender segregation in the public square."" This, they say, is because enforced gender segregation tramples on the rights of women and freedom of movement of others. 

I am trying to understand how that same argument wouldn't apply to banning circumcision. I.e, it's fine to practice religion on your own if you want, but you can't mutilate a 8 day infant without his consent.

Why is that any different? and if you did support the protest in dizengoff, do you in fact support banning circumcision? A similar argument could also be made about 'oppressive' head coverings for women and shechita.   


I am also pre-empting all the ""circumcision is medically beneficial"" arguments by noting that most medical associations do not support that, any benefit can wait until a person is 18 and elect to do it on their own, and anyway, the argument is a red herring.

My family was shaped by the Soviet Union and it's the reason why my parents were raised atheist. 

We live in a country where religion/ethics is a mandatory school subject since grade 1, so my parents chose to put me in jewish religion class, because you could easily get an A in that class just by participating. Last year I chose to take an advanced class in religion out of my huge curiosity towards judaism, which my parents supported, because all they wanted was me having A's.

This year I took things a bit further and attended friday night Shabbat service for the first time in my life. It became very quickly my highlight of the week and I even became friends with the cantor and started studying Talmud with him. I love everything about studying jewish texts and I believe in HaShem and in the Torah, I could spend the entire day just listening to shiurim.

However, since I started to go to synagogue my parents have become more critical of my rise in observance and especially my father doesn't like me going to synagogue at all, despite him not knowing anything about judaism (he asked me once if I can speak jewish). My mother joins me in going to Shabbat services, because she wants to drive me home (so I don't come home late at night) + she likes the food they serve. A few days ago I wasn't allowed to go to Yom Kippur services, because it was after school and I'd come home too late, but I never complain or argue about those prohibitions.

I sometimes ask my parents why they're so anti-judaism, since I'm not trying to be orthodox, haredi or getting them to eat kosher, but I can't get a productive conversation out of them, especially not out of my father. It's kinda confusing, since having a religious teenager sounds like one of the mildest struggles you can have as a parent, but I can't fight with them, since I don't want to make them upset, I truly love them. I can only assume that adding on to the atheist doctrine, for my mother it was the heavy antisemitism and for my father it's the heavy pride in his oriental culture (which is very deeply woven in with christianity).

All this is just a small and summed up version of how strictly my parents are against it, but I try to find hope and do what I can like wearing a tucked in tallit or praying, but judaism is filled with so many traditions surrounding family, community and celebrations I feel like I am curbed in a small cell of secularism in which I am just no longer happy in.

It suits me well- I studied Noam Chomsky’s work in my undergraduate studies in linguistics and he has certainly shaped my political views (albeit not necessarily agreeing with him- it’s the spirit of questioning the powers that be and status quo).

\*Warning: Incoming rant.

There are approximately 1220 localities in Israel, 163 of them are Arab (13%) that existed before 1948. Considering Arabs make up 21% of the population, and that the state keeps building new localities for everyone else (like this one called [חנון](https://govextra.gov.il/moin/planning-headquarters/home/city/) lol). So one would Israel to build **at least** **1** Arab locality, but it hasn't happened.

I used to think Rahat in the Negev was the only Arab city built by Israel. But I've recently learnt that  Rahat wasn't built from the ground up as a new city, it was a small village that got recognized, renamed and developed a bit.

There was an announcement in 2016 to build a town for Druze near Jadeidi-Makr, [It was riddled with controversy](https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001327993), and I don't know if a single stone has been laid. There was once also talks about a Christian town, Nothing came out of it. And ofcourse no one cares about the biggest minority in Israel, Muslims.

Rising housing prices is a nation wide problem, and building more localities is the natural response, but the government needs to be ~~thinking about~~ catering for Arabs too. Instead major resources are sunk into ['Judaizing' the Galilee](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-748451) and Negev, like why is state sponsored demographic-manipulation still even a thing in the 21'st century?!

This was done in the name of עאלק liberalism. Where freedom of religion and of assembly are such basic principles.

The justification was also incredibly illiberal. There was no sex segregation in public space. People were not shoved to specific directions based on their sex. But people voluntarily sat in the areas that would follow their religion. No event organizer forced someone to do something based on their sex. The ""partition"" was almost arbitrary, not any sort of discriminatory enforcement.

I am worried that the secular sector in Israel is adopting a minority strategy. In which as a minority they get to demand that public space in their areas accustome to their taste. This is in contrast with a liberal view where איש איש באמונתו יחיה."

They pretty much learned to read English by reading books that catered to their interests. Now, the issue with their reading is to get them to stop reading when it’s bedtime or time to get ready for school. I thought that getting them Hebrew versions of books they like might motivate them to try to do more reading in Hebrew. I got a couple for my son, from the Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Captain Underpants series, and it seems to be working.

The problem is, when I look for kids books in Hebrew online- oy! They’re outrageously expensive! I HOPE kids in Israel aren’t paying these kind of prices for kids books. Is there somewhere other than Amazon, eBay, or AbeBooks where I should be looking for kids books in Hebrew?

I left my Bible somewhere

I can’t find it anywhere

Sure as I thought 

I surely knew

That the good lord is good

That the good lord is true

I’ve learned that piety and self-preservation

Are mutually exclusive things

I don’t ask the lord for an answer

For why children die of cancer

Or starve

There is no answer to such things and

Any possible reason for them

Could never be a suitable explanation

There  is no Bible 

Under this roof 

But it’s pages turn in my heart

For even books that are leather-bound

Can burn and rot

Can be lost and never found

Can turn brittle

And fall apart

But a holy word
A sacred parable

Can sound from a pit

And resound beyond stars 

Beyond the  celestial

Last night

We celebrated a holiday that we thought commemorated 

A rare moment in history where

Being passed over was actually a good thing

Then one of us realized 

That Passover is around Easter 

And it is September

We had a laugh over celery and unleavened bread

Closed our eyes

Bowed our heads

Then took nibbles 

Heads turned to the left

Next

 The  three of us; two gentiles, one Jew

Each confessed

I considered my transgressions

And how my life is a mess

When it was my turn to get things off my chest

I drew a blank but had some requests

“Lord. Give me the fortitude to pursue gains 

that are not solely of and for this world.”

“Father. Whatever you may bless me to accomplish,

let the bounty be shared with others

And not my reward alone.

For I have stumbled along the bent path

 of achieving things for myself alone

And I know 

I could have King Solomon’s wealth

But if what I have is mine alone

I’d be poorer than a pauper

Strung-out on Skid Row

Poorer than a wretch

 born in hell.”

“God. If there is any legacy that I leave behind

Let it simply be a legacy 

Of being kind.”

And then I humbly asked.

“And where the hell is my damn Bible?

Amen”"

1,2023-09-28,Family discovery,u/JamieDeMainnMan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16u8q1q/family_discovery/,"The last couple of years I have been doing family history research, especially about my maternal great grandparents. Not much is known about them, the immigrated from Poland in the 1930’s, came through elis Island and changed their name. They died long before I was born so I never got the the chance to meet them, but my mom and aunts say they refused to talk about Poland or speak their native language. Saying instead “we are american now.” And leaving it at that. 

After some pretty extensive (and hella frustrating) deep dives in as many geneoloy archives as possible, I was finally able to find out they both came from Makow Poland. the family story goes that my Great Grandfather came to the us ahead of my great grandmother to get things settled and ready for her. She had left Macow and was staying with an aunt tor many years in Warsaw (about 45 minutes away from Makow) who worked as a seamstress.  Eventually she followed him to the us and they settled here.

When I was finally able to find the name Makow for where they had been born and lived before immigrating, I found out that the jewish population made up 90% of the total population of Makow by 1827, and that an organized jewish community untiy had been long since established there as far back as the second half of the 16th century. My great grandfather was born in 1895, my Great Grandmother 1894. So by then most of Makow was jewish.

So I was wondering if it was fairly safe to say they were most likely jewish? If so, does that mean it would be appropriate for me to reach out to a rabbi or synagogue to learn more about my heritage? I know traditionally speaking, since it was my mother’s father’s parents that neither she nor I would be considered jewish (at least that’s my understanding based on the research I’ve done so far)  but I think (?) because it is my great grandparents on my mother’s side I can say I have jewish ancestors/some heritage. 

Unfortunately in 1898 a huge fire ripped through the village and many houses in buildings were lost, including the archives where their records and a lot of religious texts were stored. So it makes it really hard to actually reach out to the place where they were from to try and access records at that time. Since their records (dob 1894 and 1895) would’ve been the ones that burned in what was referred to as “The Great Fire.”

I hope I asked correctly, I really want to learn and explore and honor my heritage, and want to make sure I’m doing so in a respectful and appropriate way."

I am wondering, if the Rabbi is providing me oversight on making the vegan sausage, and it is all only dairy and vegetarian, should I be worried about anyone being concerned about the marit ayin if it is a compelling meat pepperoni analogue? Or should the fact all attendees will have equal knowledge about the source and provenance of the food be sufficient?

1,2023-09-28,The Dark Side of Roger Waters,u/slidingsolipsisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/16uh6dc/the_dark_side_of_roger_waters/,"SS: A new documentary about Roger Waters [is out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNA6MCzyCSg) and you should all watch it and draw your own conclusions. It's mostly the lived experiences of Waters' former producer and former band mate, both of whom are Jewish. I watched it and it's clear to me that Roger Waters is a practitioner of both the old and new anti-Semitism.
Waters according to an email wanted his inflatable pig displayed at concerts to have the words ""dirty kike"" on it, and by modern progressive standards, wanting to use a blatant racial slur would normally be case closed. We'll see if that's the case for Waters. He also called someone in an email a ""fucking Jew"" and in another example derisively referred to vegetarian Lebanese food that he didn't like as ""Jew food.""
He also routinely deploys age-old anti-Semitic tropes like Jews controlling world governments, but instead of Jews doing those things, he says it's ""Zionists"" and ""Israelis"" (most of the time anyway, he occasionally slips up), and so therefore he's completely in the clear.
Why the Palestinian movement continues to go to bat for this guy and has elevated him to the face of their movement, I have no idea. But I doubt they're going to change no matter how many ethnic slurs he uses and no matter how bad he makes their movement look. Considering how often pro-Palestinians whine about being called antisemitic, you’d think they would try to avoid associating with antisemites. Why is it so hard to advocate for Palestinian rights without flirting with antisemitic tropes and demonizing people who disagree with you? Any ideas?"

Israel is literally surrounded by countries that want to exterminate not just the country but the entire Jewish population located there. During times of peace Jews love to argue and fight amongst themselves, in times of peril, they unite better than most countries. I think its internal issues will fix themselves and find a way to adapt. It’s the only advanced country with a positive birth rate and population replacement level.


Next US may potentially have colder relationships with Israel as Millenials and Gen Z who are more hostile to Israel. However the US is pulling away from the Middle East and the rest of the world in general. 

Europe may also become hostile to Israel in 2 ways by the 2030’s -2050’s. Its current Muslim immigration and birth rate will have prominent influence on the political landscape in Europe. Remember ethnic Europeans demographics are declining below replacement levels (low birth rate) and aging out. This however may cause Europeans countries to shift far right and cause internal violence with the Muslim population due to cultural clashes. If either scenario happens Jews in Europe will take blame and be targeted. Thus leave to Israel or other friendly countries. Source on data population below.

• https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2017/11/29/europes-growing-muslim-population/

Next Israel is the only high tech non western country with an infrastructure to weather through Climate Change. The rest of the MENA besides Israel’s trade partners (UAE, Morocco, maybe Saudi Arabia) will be facing harsh times due to climate change resulting in inflation of food prices and clean water, potentially causing civil unrest. Now let’s add in a youth bulge which is essentially to many young men with not enough jobs and less opportunity in marriage. let’s mix in relgious extremism and you’ve got a disaster waiting to happen. This is what caused the civil war in Syria and the rise is ISIS. The region may become more unstable especially Egypt. Which can cause havoc globally on an economic scale due to Suez Canal being closed off.

Israel will also be in an interesting power position if it becomes #3 in leadership of AI. AI is the new power play that is equivalent to nuclear weapons. If the AI breakthroughs continue I actually imagine Israel being more internally secure than today.

Iran I’m unsure of frankly as climate change can cause havoc in its own country. Or it can be the same status quo. A theocracy is harder country to rebel and change.

Then I started seeing other things including Jewish grandparent and conversion under reform or conservative, but only if done in Israel. Can someone clarify? Are patrilineal Jews qualified or non-orthodox conversions outside of Israel? Is there actually a consensus of who qualifies, or is it up to the courts in non-halachically Jewish cases?

Walking 10 minutes from East to West in Jerusalem, you can feel like you've traveled from Jordan to a pre Shoah Eastern European shtetl. 

I have mixed feelings about the city as an outsider. On one hand it's beautiful and one of the most historic cities on earth. On the other, it feels like a microcosm of a lot of Israel's social issues (the Arab-Israeli conflict, the secular religious conflict, etc). 

Everyone seems to stay in their own lane, with their own tribe. People of different walks of life walk side by side but live in separate worlds. The Haram-al Sharif/Temple Mount, the Western Wall, and the church of the Holy Sepulcher might as well be in different countries rather than blocks away from each other. 

One group that appeared to be missing though is secular Israelis: who despite making up 44% of Israeli Jews, make up only 18% of Jews of Jerusalem ([2](https://jerusaleminstitute.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/PUB_%D7%A2%D7%9C-%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9A-%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%AA-2018-%D7%93%D7%99%D7%92%D7%99%D7%98%D7%9C-%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%99_eng.pdf)). I was wondering how secular Israelis viewed their capital city. Do you guys view it as a place of tension, an important part of your heritage and history, poor and provincial, all of the above?"

Ecclesiastes 1:15
What is crooked cannot he made straight, and what is lacking cannot be numbered.
If we lack holiness to our God, if we are bent and not straight enough as in straight of being obedient to him and following his laws, we desperately need a savior, whether you think of it or not we do. 
Psalm 22:

“My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me? Why are You so far from helping Me, And from the words of My groaning? O My God, I cry in the daytime, but You do not hear; And in the night season, and am not silent. But You are holy, Enthroned in the praises of Israel. Our fathers trusted in You; They trusted, and You delivered them. They cried to You, and were delivered; They trusted in You, and were not ashamed. But I am a worm, and no man; A reproach of men, and despised by the people. All those who see Me ridicule Me; They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, “He trusted in the Lord, let Him rescue Him; Let Him deliver Him, since He delights in Him!” But You are He who took Me out of the womb; You made Me trust while on My mother’s breasts. I was cast upon You from birth. From My mother’s womb You have been My God. Be not far from Me, For trouble is near; For there is none to help. Many bulls have surrounded Me; Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled Me. They gape at Me with their mouths, Like a raging and roaring lion. I am poured out like water, And all My bones are out of joint; My heart is like wax; It has melted within Me. My strength is dried up like a potsherd, And My tongue clings to My jaws; You have brought Me to the dust of death. For dogs have surrounded Me; The congregation of the wicked has enclosed Me. They pierced My hands and My feet; I can count all My bones. They look and stare at Me. They divide My garments among them, And for My clothing they cast lots.”
‭‭Psalms‬ ‭22‬:‭1‬-‭18‬ ‭NKJV‬‬ ‬
And the savior is portrayed here in this beautiful messianic sign. I want you to consider this, who in history has been pierced? Whose bones were out of joint? Was this the man on the cross?
I want to be clear I am simply just trying to point you guys to our savior. Still not convinced?
Ok in the Bible there is four different gospels, now in these 4, there is 3 and they stand out in this psalm, why?
3 of these gospels recorded the death of Jesus. Now, these gospels Matthew, Mark, and Luke say that the high priests (I’m not shaming Jews) said to him something along the lines of, “If you are the Son of Man come down from the cross” and if you look at verse 7-8 in psalm 22. You cannot deny it. But let’s say you still don’t believe that’s fine no worries

Let’s look at Zachariah one of the prophets.

““Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your King is coming to you; He is just and having salvation, Lowly and riding on a donkey, A colt, the foal of a donkey.”
‭‭Zechariah‬ ‭9‬:‭9‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
Ok that’s another prophecy alright and this one is straight to the point, it calls the man riding a donkey your KING. 
Now let’s look at the gospels:

“So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them. They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him on them. And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road; others cut down branches from the trees and spread them on the road. Then the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: “Hosanna to the Son of David! ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’ Hosanna in the highest!” And when He had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, “Who is this?” So the multitudes said, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.””
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭21‬:‭6‬-‭11‬ ‭‬‬
Okay now as I mentioned we all need a savior, and at the time you’re reading this you do as well, and your mom. 

“But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed.”
‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭53‬:‭5‬ ‭‬‬

This savior, like I’m trying to show you is Jesus. Ok we’ll say you don’t believe in the Bible, let’s look at an outside source. Here is Tacitus a Roman. 
Christus= Jesus


“Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus."" 
This comes from his book “Annals”


“Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel.”
‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭7‬:‭14‬

Please even if you scoff what I said and my evidence, think about it. I am no prophet as far as I know but there will be a beast and he will claim to be a Messiah, but in reality not. He will show signs to you.
Thank you so much so so so much for your time, I do not mean to cause disputes.
Message me if you have doubts or want to talk about this, thank you again!"
1,2023-09-28,Modern day prophets?,u/notfrumenough,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16ur6u1/modern_day_prophets/,"Torah has a foundation of prophets, prophetesses and prophecies and thus Judaism has an underlying foundation of prophecies as well. The entire nation of Israel witnessed miracles and prophecies from Egypt to Sinai. Our forefathers and mothers are all prophets. The coming of Moshiach is a prophecy yet to be fulfilled, G-d willing.

Now for thousands of years we have stopped receiving messages and commandments from Hashem. We do have instances of tzaddiks “becoming pregnant with the soul” of other tzaddiks and channeling great works. For example Rav Ashlag/Baal HaSulam. However if someone were to make a claim of receiving guidance now from “beyond” this material world (like from Hashem) most people would not believe that’s valid at all. I’m just thinking out loud wondering why.

My theory is that the arrival of false prophets has made it impossible to be anything but skeptical of anyone who claims to be a prophet. In this day and age, if somebody claims to be receiving messages from G-d they are immediately painted as crazy at worst or woo woo at best. 

So, when moshiach arrives we may not believe him/her. We’ll expect solid evidence that cannot be disputed much in the way that pharaoh did with Moses. To be fair Moshe was met with relentless doubt and skepticism as well even after miracles were witnessed, and of course, that struggle between doubt and emunah is part of climbing the ladder. Striving for a relationship with Hashem so it can be a strong one.

So now if someone starts saying they’re receiving messages from G-d of love and reassurance as well as prophecies: that floods are coming for example, that cities will be wiped from the face of the Earth, that another arc is to be made, that natural mikvahs must be preserved, that Torah will repeat itself — just saying we’re probably not going to listen to them are we. If they say that moshiach is coming in our lifetime and Hashem will be upon the throne in the third temple and Jews will return to the nation of Israel and to the garden, we already know this prophecy and it’s nothing new, and we probably would just say yes yes Moshiach now!

So how will we know when a prophet is real? Moshe was humble and reluctant to believe that even he is a worthy prophet. Should we expect new prophets to also hesitate and fear?  What miracles will we have to witness to believe ourselves? 

How many more spin off religions are to come from false messiahs? What happens if we fuck it up by not believing? Or can we not fuck it up because it will be undeniable when Hashem is upon us?

Still just thinking out loud thanks for listening / your input"

I am pro-settlements as they undo the ethnic cleansing perpetrated against the Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.  I am also sick and tired of the one-sided approach that the UN takes when addressing the Israel/Palestinian conflict.

Here are some excerpts:
  
>“Settlements further entrench the occupation, fuel violence, impede Palestinian access to their land and resources, and systematically erode the viability of a Palestinian State as part of a two-State solution”, the senior envoy said
  
This portrays a two-state solution as a viable path forward while ignoring the history of Palestinians rejecting every two-state solution offered and the current climate of Palestinians rejecting anything other than a one state solution and the destruction of Israel in the process.  I'm curious if the continued insistence that a two-state solution is viable is actually furthering the conflict.  What do you guys think?  Shouldn't the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process recognize this and work towards a solution that is more viable and in line with reality?
  
>“I call on the Government of Israel to cease all settlement activity and dismantle outposts immediately, in line with its obligations under international law,” he added.
  
This calls on Israel to support a policy of ethnic cleansing in the West Bank.  Anytime someone calls for the removal of the settlements they are calling for ethnic cleansing of the land.
  
>The regular briefings stem from Security Council resolution 2334, adopted in December 2016, which demanded that Israel stop building new settlements on **Palestinian land**.
  
This implies that the land belongs only to Palestinians and ignores that Jews lived there prior to being murdered and driven out starting in 1948.  This is a very common way to trick people into believing that it is Palestinian land and that Jews have no right to live there.
  
>There have been casualties on both sides. Palestinians, including children, were killed or injured during demonstrations, clashes, security operations, and attacks, while Israelis, including members of the security forces, suffered casualties also.
  
This goes out of its way to cite Palestinian children have been killed while ignoring that a lot of those children were in fact combatants and ""oh by the way"" Israelis suffered casualties too.  They then go on to condemn terrorism but leave it up to the reader to assume who the terrorists are.  Some will assume that the terrorists are Israelis killing Palestinian children.
  
For me this is just another example of the bias employed at the UN against Israel."

We were never super close in school but have always been friends and since covid we have been meeting up to hang out every couple months. She has always been religious (to a normal ish extent) but when we were in school she never talked to me about it and we were just normal friends. (except this one time in 5th grade when she told me the story of Adam and Eve and Jesus or something then asked me If I believed in Jesus “even tho my ppl think it’s wrong” (I’m Jewish) and I said yes bc I didn’t know what religion was and it seemed like a big deal and like she wanted me to say yes.) Since we have been meeting up her relationship w god seems to be stronger since she has been talking about it more. At first it started off as her just saying things like “I’m going to pray about it” “god is guiding me on my path” etc when talking about stuff in her life and that’s fine and doesn’t bother me.

The problem is that more recently (like the past year or so) she has been talking this way in relation to things happening in my life, and at first I was just like this is how she sees the world, whatever (even tho it did make me uncomfortable and just felt weird) but as of late it feels like she’s full blown preaching at me and subtly implying that I need to embrace god (like the Christian god and the Bible and all that). Like maybe in her mind she thinks she’s planting seeds in my mind but I just feel really disrespected and gross about it all. I am Jewish (Not really religious,more so just cultural, but it’s a big part of my identity) and she knows this, which is why it feels even wronger to me and in some ways a little antisemitic, but I don’t want to be dramatic. To me it feels like an attack on my identity and like she it’s trying to subtlety “get me to the right side” with the way she says things. 

This really became apparent to me the last time we hung out, when I was talking about how I was struggling with things in my life and she basically said that not everything is up to me to fix, (which I agree with) it’s up to god and if I let him into my life things will get better. Then after that she invited me to the movies w some of her friends from church (she has done this in the past, the only time she has invited me places with other ppl or tried to set me up with someone it was always from her church/someone Christian) and said she is inviting me bc she wants me to “meet good ppl” which really rubbed me the wrong way especially after her lecture about god in my life and how she hopes I find god/Jesus even tho I’m Jewish and may not see things “that” way. All these things on their own isn’t that bad but everything together just makes me feel like she has an adgenda and isn’t respectful/okay with my identity.

I have been having these feeling for a while now but after the last time we hung out I decided I need to say something and was going to today when we met up, but I ended up backing out bc I’m worried what I want to say is too harsh or she’ll stop being friend with me, and even tho Ik I’m not in the wrong I don’t want to lose her as a friend. Ik I need to talk to her about this but idk how to say the things I want to say without upsetting her and kinda disregarding her world view"

Context:

I am a Jewish college student enrolled in a literature course that covers the “Old Testament” as translated by Robert Alter. (For anyone unfamiliar with Alter, he’s currently the Emeritus Professor of Hebrew and Comparative Literature at the University of California at Berkeley). Besides one other student, whose grandfather is Jewish, everyone in the class is Christian.

Problem:

There is a student in my class (mid-60s) who has said some very questionable things lately. Before class today, she said to another student: “There’s no way they went through Egypt and came out looking like that—” then pointed in my direction. Since she is older, I don’t think she cared that I could hear her over the other conversations in the class. In fact, I feel that she intended for me to hear that comment. Also, I’ve started to speculate that she subscribes to the belief that she is a “real Jew” as opposed to me: a fake European one. 

For example, during a discussion regarding Genesis 34 and the killing of the Shechemites, our Professor asked us to give one reason why this event might have been wrong in the eyes of G-d. I guessed that it might be wrong because the circumcision of the Shechemites can be interpreted as conversion, and *later* it will become a law not to kill, and especially not to kill another Jew. That student laughed at this comment. I can’t understand what was funny.

Current Situation:

Finally, and this is why I’ve come here for advice, I think my professor absolutely failed today’s lecture. We were reading from Exodus 16–40, and discussing 34:29: “Moses did not know that the skin of his face had glowed” —a verse commonly mistranslated as: “he knew not that his face was horned” so our professor showed us images where Moses is depicted with horns. 

While he was showing the images, that student kept saying “There must be a reason! There must be a reason!” implying that it wasn’t a mistranslation from Latin and that Moses did have horns on his head. These comments ignite a sea of conversation, and now the entire class is wondering why Moses looks like the Devil. Then, instead of talking about antisemitism, libel, or how this mistranslation heightened the hatred of Jews in the Middle Ages and beyond, the professor brings up the Protestant Reformation. Yes, in our “Old Testament” literature class, we aren’t discussing Jews, we are discussing the breakup of Catholics and Christians. I love a maximalist approach to literature, so I am always on board with discussing history, but why not Jewish history in a Jewish literature class? (As a reminder, we are reading a Jewish scholar’s translation of the Bible, and utilizing other versions only to compare syntax.)

Question(s):

Do I drop the course for my mental health? Do I email the professor? Do you think I’m making something out of nothing? 

**TLDR;**

Enrolled in an “Old Testament” literature course where everyone is Christian. The professor doesn’t seem interested in discussing historical context unless it’s from a Christian perspective. Also, I speculate that a student in the class believes she is a “real Jew” and her comments make me uncomfortable. "

I consider myself very connected to Judaism in an academic, cultural, and communal way, but never saw myself as really religious. I find value in going to services and like to wear a kippa, keep kosher, and wrap tefillin, but I never do any of it consistently.

This summer, I developed some really bad health issues that put me in one of the worst spots of my life so far. I don't want to go into details, but it is a combination of physical and mental issues that are really terrible. I'm probably going to take a leave of absence from college and just feel really lost.

As a result of this, I've been trying more to connect to and pray to God. Not that I feel like I deserve anything, but it just feels like the right thing to do at this time. I'm treating my sicknesses, slowly, but know that God has a plan and I want to have a relationship with Them while it's going on.

But I don't really know what I'm doing or how I should be doing it. Sometimes I just put my hands together and just say stuff, and sometimes I open my siddur and try my best but I don't know. Watching Christians pray on TV and talk to God in their own way makes me insecure that I'm not doing it in a very Jewish way. Can Jews just pray to God when they feel like it? Is feeling like ""God has a plan/all things happen for a reason"" an unjewish concept?

During Yom Kippur services a few days ago, our Rabbi cited a talmudic story that purported that the Gates of Prayer are open to those who are suffering. Does that mean my prayers are like theoretically heard?

I know these questions don't have clear answers, but I'm interested in hearing a range of perspectives. Thank you everyone."

> Saudi Arabia is determined to secure a military pact requiring the United States to defend the kingdom in return for opening ties with Israel and will not hold up a deal even if Israel does not offer major concessions to Palestinians in their bid for statehood, three regional sources familiar with the talks said.

...

> The Palestinians could get some Israeli restrictions eased but such moves would fall short of their aspirations for a state. As with other Arab-Israeli deals forged over the decades, the Palestinian core demand for statehood would take a back seat, the three regional sources familiar with the talks said.

...

> ""The normalization will be between Israel and Saudi Arabia. If the Palestinians oppose it the kingdom will continue in its path,"" said one of the regional sources. ""Saudi Arabia supports a peace plan for the Palestinians, but this time it wanted something for Saudi Arabia, not just for the Palestinians.""

More and more Arab countries are deciding that the Palestinian cause is apparently, not that important to them.

Perhaps it is the understanding by their leaders, that after numerous refused peace initiatives and amazing deals proposed, while the Palestinian population keeps supporting senseless terrorism and violence, and only get more extreme with very passing year, the issue as of right now is simply unsolvable.

All this while Israel offers great opportunities for trade, protection, improved relations with the west and in general is very open and flexible to many kinds of deals and peace treaties.

Israelis have no problems with Arab countries. As proven by the long standing peace and cooperation between Israel and it's more peaceful neighbors. Made even clearer by the new normalization with the UAE and the hundreds of thousands of Israelis who already travelled there or companies doing business in Dubai.

The Palestinian violent struggle, mainly targeting innocent civilians, plus it's international attempts at harming Israel such as the BDS movement, seem to have completely lost hope of making any meaningful changes.

The last few years have seen Israeli economy rising to the 14th place GDP country in the world, more and more Arab countries normalizing relations, huge weapon deals with European countries wanting Israeli technology for their protection and the Palestinians, still ruled by holocaust denying, terror funding dictators, are pretty much left behind.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_and_crying

I recently found that the movie *Waltz with Bashir* was getting a lot of hate online (from movie critics) for being too sympathetic towards Israeli soldiers.

I personally don’t really understand this term because any movie that focuses on war is going to focus on the characters that endure terrible deeds and soldiers are no exception. It feels like a pro-Palestine propaganda attempt to delegitimise Israeli cinema but I honestly don’t know. It only seems to have become more popular recently and I find it bizarre. Some of the best war films around (*Waltz with Bashir*, *Kippur* and *Hill 24 Doesn’t Answer*) are Israeli. Personally I don’t understand delegitimising a movie because of its political message. But that’s what really confuses me about the online hate for *Waltz with Bashir* - I never got the feeling once that it was pro-Israel or pro-war. In fact it seems to be incredibly focused on the horrors of the Lebanon War, which leads me to question the potential propaganda of this loaded term.

I understand that it’s possible that Israeli filmmakers first used it but whenever I hear it used now it seems that it’s being used by anti-Israel opinions.

I just came across this article (which he has since expanded into a book) and it was eye opening. I often get in arguments with people on social media who claim that Arab violence against Jews in the region is simply an understandable response to Zionist ethnic cleansing (and more recently, occupation) by explaining that it is actually rooted in hatred of Jews and the Arab unwillingness to accept a Jewish homeland on ""their"" soil. But aside from the role of Al-Husseini in spreading antisemitic hate, I've never had much else to offer as support for my argument. Until I read this.

I simply had no idea how significant a role the Nazis played in sowing antisemitic hate throughout the Arab world in the years leading up to and during WWII. Their efforts have had longstanding disastrous effect on Israel and the diaspora."

There were two brothers, Caleb and Ralph. Ralph was the older brother in 4th or 5th grade and Caleb had just started kindergarten or first. They were both Jewish. It's not a Jewish area, and I was one of the only Jewish adults they met outside of their shul, so they would always make a point of telling me all the things they were learning in Hebrew school. 

Caleb was especially attached to me. He and Ralph would get into arguments because Ralph was at that age when he didn't want to be seen hanging out with his little kid brother. Caleb had the best one-liners. One time when Ralph told him he didn't want to help him play on the ""baby computer""( the kids computer with the bulky plastic casing that only has Arthur games on it that you don't need to sign up for) Caleb balled up his fists and said ""I wish I had some wolves, and I would take them into battle against you!"" 

One day I notice Caleb looking really sad and sulking behind a book shelf, so I go over and ask my little dude what's up. Figured he and Ralph got into another argument or something. Caleb looked at me, and he said ""did you hear about the bad man?""
"" what bad man?""
"" Hitler. I heard my dad talking about Hitler with ( name of their rabbi)"" and his eyes really started to well up with tears. I go "" oh, I see. What did they say about Hitler?""
""Hitler hated juice. He wanted to get rid of all the juice. That's so mean. Everyone should be able to drink all the juice they want"".  

He was SO upset. I guess they hadn't told him about that part of history yet. I wasn't going to be the one to do it because I wasn't sure if that's what his dad wanted for him at the time. They had just lost their mom not too long before that. I told his dad the story about "" Jews"" as ""juice"" when he came to get them. 

It's just a story that I thought I'd share. I'm glad our people have Caleb amongst our ranks. That kid is gonna grow up and make our people proud."

If it’s not, then please feel free to delete this post and/or redirect me. 

God made a covenant with Noah not to flood the earth with water again (Genesis 9:13). I was taught that this was because he found favor in the eyes of God (Genesis 6:9) and because Noah was heartbroken after seeing so much death during the flood. So, I imagine when God made this covenant with Noah, it brought him a great sense of peace and joy. Later God made a covenant with King David that a future King would rule over the people of God. This laid the foundation for the Messiah. My question is what inspired the Davidic Covenant? Did David have some sort of righteous motivator like Noah? Did this covenant bring David a great sense of peace and if so – why? 

If I misunderstand any of this, then I welcome correction. I just want to learn the truth on a deeper level. "
1,2023-09-29,A1 visa;,u/NeilTheGrassieBison,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/16vfdp0/a1_visa/,"Hey all - patrilineal Jewish who did a Giyur from a recognised reform community in the U.S.

So, long story short, it’s going to take forever to get the documents certifying my dad’s Jewish by birth status, as he nor my grandmother nor her parents were ever a part of a recognised community. It’s a little further back, but my dad is still a Jew by birth, but only through a technicality. Funnily enough birthright recognises my current evidence of my dad being a Jew without an orthodox rabbi signing off on it lol. Just a conservative or reform one.

I could in theory apply for the Law of Return through him but it would take forever and I’ve been told my some orthodox rabbis that they won’t sign off on it unless he returns to practicing Halachic Judaism, which he has no desire to (he’s not religious and doesn’t care to help me in this).  


So pretty much, while eligible in theory through my father, in practice, it’s different.

I am finishing up a reform conversion and have been a member of this community for over a year, and I am really wanting to make aliyah.


I’d rather not wait the whole 9mo post-conversion, and I know I could apply for an A1 visa and live in Israel for 9mo in a recognised reform community there, which would be upgraded to citizenship after 9mo in Israel as a reform community member. 

The reason I’m trying to expedite it is because I know how long Israeli bureaucracy can take, I’m 25, and I’d like to volunteer for IDF service and do an orthodox conversion through the IDF Nativ program.

I want to be a participating member of the state and contribute the best I can.

So here are some of my questions;

1.) Does anyone have experience doing an A1 visa to circumvent the long process of aliyah from abroad? I feel it would be much quicker there once 9mo is completed, to make aliyah;

2.) I don’t want to age out (I am 25 - age out is 29)) - can I join the IDF on an A1 visa?

3.) About how long would it take to get an A1 visa approved? Reform/conservative conversions are recognised for aliyah and A1.


4.) Any other advice?

Thanks y’all! ♥️"

I say this not because a Palestinian lense isn't important, but because I know so much of that perspective and would like to see the other side. 

I want to clear up that I believe in the right for Israel to exist, and I believe the people living in Israel, specifically the Jewish people, have the right to live on their land in peace, I feel the exact same way about Palestine. I believe that all the people that have been displaced and removed from their homes and towns deserve to live in their land in peace. 

My confusion comes from the fact that many Israelis or non Israeli Jewish people have a big issue with people being anti Zionist, from my knowledge Zionism is the right for a Jewish persons righ to self determination. This makes sense I'm not confused about this , but I am confused that when that self determination has actively hurt another ethnic group that needed to be significantly displaced in order for the Jewish/Israeli population to achieve Zionism, doesnt this then prevent the Palestinian population from reaching that very same self determination? I know that many Israelis are pro Palestine which is awsome, but how do you I guess accept the right to one populations right to self determination, when another population had to lose their right to self determination in order for the original population to be able to achieve Zionism? 

Does this have anything to do with Jewish people being indigenous to the Israel palestine area? Because they are the indigenous group did this justify the loss of Palestinian's land and homes, when those people had been living in the area and also had their identities and culture tied to it?

I want to again clarify that I think Israelis have a right to live in Israel, but I don't think that this right should have been obtained by displacing a population that had already been established there. I want to know what Israelis or Jewish people think about this? Do you generally agree and think it was unjust, or do you think it was justified and why? Again I'm not questioning the current right Israelis have to their land, I'm questioning the action of displacing a native population, however I don't think that because this action was unjust tht Israel should he abolished as a nation 

I hope I got my point across well, I'm a Palestine supporter but I know how much anti semitism exists in general and I don't want a Jewish person to think I am questioning their right to live peacefully"

They decide to live a 100% secular life, they never wanted to connect with the past. 12 years ago I decided start my journey to rescue my past, and I joined a reform synagogue.

There is not a single day that I dont need to explain about my history and past. Some asked: do you have documents to proof your history?

1,2023-09-29,"We're gonna be okay, we have Caleb.",u/Imaginary-Cricket903,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16vield/were_gonna_be_okay_we_have_caleb/,"I used to work in a small public library, in the Children's book section ( which was one of the biggest collections in the library) where all the local school kids would flock to everyday after school. It was the best job I ever had, and I was there for long enough to get to know most of the regulars. 

There were two brothers, Caleb and Ralph. Ralph was the older brother in 4th or 5th grade and Caleb had just started kindergarten or first. They were both Jewish. It's not a Jewish area, and I was one of the only Jewish adults they met outside of their shul, so they would always make a point of telling me all the things they were learning in Hebrew school. 

Caleb was especially attached to me. He and Ralph would get into arguments because Ralph was at that age when he didn't want to be seen hanging out with his little kid brother. They'd get into squabbles. Nothing super serious. Caleb had the best one-liners. One time when Ralph told him he didn't want to help him play on the ""baby computer""( the kids computer with the bulky plastic casing that only has Arthur games on it that you don't need to sign up for) Caleb balled up his fists and said ""I wish I had some wolves, and I would take them into battle against you!"" 

He was always saying stuff like that. Me and the other librarian used to write down our favorite Caleb lines, because they were always so...perfectly unusual. He wasn't just gonna call his brother names or threaten to tell their dad, like you would expect. No, Caleb was going to get a bunch of wolves and he was going to use them to ""take them into battle and get victory"".  

One day I notice Caleb looking really sad and sulking behind a bookshelf, so I go over and ask my little dude what's up. Figured he and Ralph got into another argument or something. Caleb looked at me, and he said ""did you hear about the bad man?""
""what bad man?""
""Hitler. I heard my dad talking about Hitler with ( name of their rabbi)"" and his eyes really started to well up with tears. I felt my heart drop, like...oh..shit I don't know how to handle *this* conversation with a kid who isn't mine while I'm at work, but he's crying so I can't ignore this. Shit. So, I say "" Oh, hm.. I see. What did they say about Hitler?"" 
""Hitler hated juice. He wanted to get rid of all the juice. That's so mean. Everyone should be able to drink all the juice they want"".  

He was SO upset. I was a little taken aback when I realized he was talking about a beverage, but he was legitimately upset. I guess they hadn't told him about that part of history yet. He overheard adults talking in another room and somehow got ""Jews"" confused with "" juice"" and that was enough to make him upset. I wasn't going to be the one to tell him all the real stuff ( I think I said something like ""I'm not so sure that's what they meant. Maybe you should talk to your rabbi about it"")  because I wasn't sure if that's what his dad wanted for him at the time, and it wasn't my place to decide how the truth was going to be explained to him. They had just lost their mom not too long before that, so it wasn't my place to explain the details of the holocaust to him. I told his dad the story about "" Jews"" as ""juice"" when he came to get them though and he got a little chuckle out of it. 

It's just a story that I thought I'd share. I'm glad our people have Caleb amongst our ranks. That kid is gonna grow up and make our people proud. I feel better knowing he and his wolf army will be watching over us. 

Since then I've moved into an area with even fewer Jews, and lately I've had some pretty rough incidents related to this fact. 

No joke, sometimes when I read the news or see antisemitic stuff posted on my local Nextdoor or whatever, I have to remind myself that there is this kid out there- who cried at the idea of an injustice such as people not being allowed to have juice, who was determined to  raise a wolf army of some kind, and he is gonna be a force to be reckoned with one day. We're gonna be okay everyone."

I’m a Kavkazi Jew(Azerbaijan) born & raised in the US. When I get asked where I’m from, I hesitate to say Azerbaijan because I’m not *from* Azerbaijan, my Jewish ancestors just spent the diaspora there.  

So usually, I’ll either say “I’m Jewish” or “I’m American, *ethnically* Jewish.” 

“I’m Jewish” seems to make the most sense. After all, if you ask an Assyrian, where they’re from, they’ll tell you “I’m Assyrian.” But with “I’m Jewish,” then comes the ignorant human who responds, “tHaT’s a rElIgion,” and I grow very tired of trying to explain and still getting told I’m wrong. 

Perhaps “I’m from Judea/Israel” should be the default. 

How do you guys respond when someone asks where you’re from?"

We go to a small school, which is surprisingly diverse and excepting. Amy herself is a trans woman, which is why I was shocked we she started making strange comments about me.

I had brought my really fancy Talmud into class one day to show one of my Jewish teachers. I live in an area with very few Jews, so her and I spend a lot of study halls just talking about Jew-stuff. Amy took it from me and asked if the whole thing was written in Chinese. It was a one time incident, and I thought I was just an honest mistake.

During Hanukkah last year, she commented that Christmas and Hanukkah were the “same thing,” which really bothered me, since one of our special holidays seems to always get overshadowed by Christmas, despite it not being Jesus’ real birthday but instead a plot to steal the solstice from the Pagans. Whole other issue.

Recently, she’s started calling me “fucking/stupid/dumb Jew” as an insult. It’s honestly very upsetting, and annoying. Today, she unprompted told me that my new contact name in her phone is “That One Jew.”

I’ve called her out before, and she stopped for a little bit, but now the antisemitism is back. It’s just really hard seeing all the negativity towards us, and now I’m seeing it in a space where I always felt accepted.

Honestly she does a lot of other things that piss me off, so it might be time to rethink the friendship.

In my opinion, there’s nothing more tried and true in the Jewish character than the shared experience of antisemitism. It’s what like half of our holidays are about (maybe more I didn’t do the math).

Just want some advice from the council."

The Karaite tradition is below: 

The holiday lasts eight days, on the first and last day the Torah forbids us to work. The eighth day of Sukkot is called the ""Day of Gathering""; in ancient times, on this day, the Cohens and Levites read and explained the Torah to the people. It is probably the custom to start the new annual cycle of reading the Torah with the first chapter.

On the first day of the Feast of Tabernacles, the book of Vaikra (Leviticus) is read from 22:27 to the end of chapter 23. On the eighth day, the last chapter of Devarim (Deuteronomy) is read, and the first chapter of Bereshit (Genesis) begins.

On Sukkot, it is customary to have a feast with fruits and vegetables and grape wine. Houses are decorated with branches and flowers. A sukkah is placed near the kenasa, fruits are hung inside. In the more northern regions, where the Karaites live, in areas where rye and wheat are grown, a sheaf of ears of corn decorated with flowers is solemnly brought to the kenasa, and it stands there until the next holiday.
